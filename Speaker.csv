"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth Speaker Comparison -- 2017 Edition,5,"I was in need of a new portable speaker, and like many of you, I was a little overwhelmed after doing an Amazon search and finding literally tens of thousands of options to choose from.  It's especially frustrating because probably the most important part of the product -- how good it sounds -- is not something you can really evaluate until after you physically have it.  So I picked four speakers to compare: Cambridge Soundworks OontZ Angle 3 Plus, Anker SoundCore Sport XL, Geek Beats Jolt5, and the JBL Flip 4.First, the 
Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker
, is a slightly larger version of the best-selling speaker on Amazon with over 17,000 reviews and a $30 price tag, and this only costs $5 more, so why not give it a shot?  I chose 
Anker SoundCore Sport XL Outdoor Portable Bluetooth Speaker - 16W Output and 2 Subwoofers, IP67 Waterproof & Dustproof, Shockproof, 66ft Bluetooth Range, 15H Playtime, Built-in Mic, USB Charging Port
, partially because I have other Anker products that I'm pretty happy with, but also because the 66-foot advertised range seemed like it could come in handy if I were working in the backyard with my phone in my pocket and the speaker sitting on the porch.  I selected the 
GEEK BEATS JOLT5 10W X-Bass Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker and USB Power Bank - Green. IP65 Water and Dust Resistant with 5200mAh Samsung Battery.
 because it's the same price as the Anker, it has an average of 4.9 stars (wow!), and it can be used as a battery to charge your phone.  And finally, I chose the 
JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black)
 because in my search, I kept seeing the JBL Flip 3 pop up in reviews for other speakers, and this is the newest (and supposedly slightly better) version of that speaker.Sound Comparison:  Sitting in my living room and swapping around between the four options, it's clear that the Flip 4 is the most, well, clear.  Considering it's also the most expensive, I kinda expected that to be the result.  Surprisingly, the OontZ was a solid second place with a bit more rumble in its bass compared to the Flip 4 but at the cost of less clarity.  The Anker and Jolt5 were noticeably flatter in their sound, seeming to favor the lows instead of an overall range, and this caused some distortion at higher volumes.  When I took the speakers outside, it's a slightly different story.  With the speakers on the patio, I walked into the yard about 25 feet and compared the sound quality again, and again I'd put the Flip 4 in the top spot.  This time, however, I'd actually say the Anker was a solid number 2.  At this distance, the distortion from having the volume up the whole way was not very noticeable and didn't detract from the music I was playing, and the Anker is a bit louder than the OontZ.  The Jolt5 is a distant last place being not only flat but also not as loud.  It's comparable to listening to the radio on a boombox from the 90s.Bluetooth Range:  With the speakers inside, all four started cutting in and out around the same spot about 30 feet away.  It's around a corner, so having a wall in the way seems to even the odds here.  Having an open space outside didn't seem to make a difference to the Jolt5, though, as it still broke up around 30 feet.  The product page on Amazon says 33 feet, so that's pretty accurate.  The OontZ fared a bit better and almost made it to the back gate about 60 feet away.  The Anker is pretty spot on with its advertised 66-foot range as it went a bit further than the OontZ, even onto the other side of the gate and almost into the road.  The Flip 4 was still going strong when I got to the other side of the road and couldn't go any further in a straight line, maybe 75 feet.Other Things:  Depending on what exactly you plan on using your speaker for, and just for comparison's sake, there are some differences that may be worth note:-- All four speakers come with a mini-USB to USB charging cable but not the plug.  If you've charged a cell phone in the last 10 years or so, however, you should probably already have one.-- The Jolt5 and OontZ come with a 3.5mm cable so you can plug your phone right into it instead of using bluetooth (though all four speakers have this option, just not the cable).-- The Anker and Jolt5 have a USB port so they can be used as a portable battery to charge your phone.-- The Anker, Flip 4, and Jolt5 have hand straps.  The OontZ does not come with one nor have a place to attach one.-- The Anker, Flip 4, and Jolt5 have audible cues when they power on or off.  The OontZ is silent.  All four speakers do, however, make a noise when you successfully pair a device through bluetooth.-- All four speakers are splash resistant, but only the Anker and Flip 4 are likely to live if they fall into the water (submersible up to 30 minutes)-- The Anker and Jolt5 are shock resistant, so they likely won't shatter if you drop them-- The OontZ has the longest battery life (30 hours) and the Flip 4 has the shortest (12 hours)-- The Flip 4 can be paired with other Flip 4's (through an app) to provide a wireless multi-speaker experience.  There are Bluetooth adapters that would allow you to do this with the other speakers if you wanted, as well as physically connecting them with 3.5mm cables.-- The Flip 4 comes in a variety of colors.-- They are all roughly the same size, just differently shaped (see pics)Conclusion:  The best bang for your buck is the OontZ Angle 3 Plus.  It's a measly $35 and sounds almost as good as the $100 Flip 4, especially inside.  In addition to being inexpensive, you can literally keep it blaring music for an entire day.  It's not quite as loud outside as the Anker or Flip 4, but it's also half the price.  If you're willing to pay for premium sound, go with the Flip 4 or even the Flip 3 if you want to save 20 bucks.  Supposedly the sound is comparable, just the Flip 4 has a longer playtime.  It really is noticeably clearer compared to the other options, so if you were using it with a projector to watch a movie, for example, the rumbling and distortion aren't going to drown out the dialogue, and likewise vocals on a music track don't get lost in the rest of the noise.  If you're planning on a bunch of outside activities, like mountain biking or camping, the ruggedness of the Anker and ability for it to charge your phone makes it your best bet.  I didn't do a drop test with any of these, but the Anker feels like a rubberized brick and would probably survive a fall.  Other than battery life, there's no reason to ever choose the Jolt5 over the Anker, especially considering they are the same price.  The Jolt5 is just worse in every way, and I honestly don't understand its 4.9 rating.The Jolt5 is going back.  The Flip 4 is staying.  I'm still debating between the Anker and OontZ and may keep them both since the cost combined is still less than a Flip 4.EDIT:  After further testing, the Anker is going back and I'm keeping the OontZ.  When plugged in with a 3.5mm cable, the sound is dramatically better with way more bass and a louder volume.  And it's still somehow the cheapest one.TL;DR:-- On a budget?  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Plus-- Best sound?  JBL Flip 4 (though I do wish it had a bit more bass)-- Most likely to survive your abuse?  Anker SoundCore Sport XL"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wireless/ portable  Great Sound,5,I have loved this little speaker ever since I bought it.  I am hearing impaired.  This little guy let me hear my you tube music list while in the shower.  My only gripe is the battery started to lose charge with in a month after the warranty expired in 2022.  I will probably buy another one.  I originally had a cheap speaker and only paid like $39.  It died within a few months.  I think JBL could figure out a way for us to replace the battery.  I purchased it 2020.  So I guess 2 years is the life of the battery.  It still sounds awesome.  I just have to plug it in after about an hour time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound for a little speaker,5,"Very good sound quality, and good bass for such a small speaker.  Seems durable and well constructed.  Battery life is good, lasts a few hours if used continuously so it's good to plug in if you're using it for long stretches.  Comes with a usb charging cable, so to plug it in you'll need one of those little usb plug cubes.  Overall though very happy with this speaker, good value for the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Versatile, good sound, works very well as a speakerphone for conference calls",5,"Bought this as a speakerphone system for conference calls. Having tried other systems I did not have high hopes, but this system works surprisingly well for conference calls.  I've asked others in the meeting regarding voice quality and have been assured that it is clear aside from a ""change in timbre"" from my headset.The music quality is a bit too boomy for my liking and too tinny if I turn bass boost off, but is good for a small speaker.Voice conferencing quality has the same boominess issue which can cause certain voices to be hard to hear.  In such situations I find that instead of turning bass boost off (which doesn't help much) just facing the speakers downwards helps."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Concert quality sound,5,"I was introduced to this speaker when my son visited over the Christmas holiday. He propped it up on the window sill in the kitchen and tuned into some Christmas music. It was a nice addition to the overall holiday ambiance. Being a huge NFL fan, I bought this speaker primarily to listen SiriusXM football coverage on channel 88. But if I'm in relaxation mode, reading a book, or working on a project, l will call up some of my favorite music and play it in the background. I still can't believe the sound quality from such a compact speaker. Great range from booming bass to the highest notes of orchestral string instruments."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little Bluetooth speaker,4,"It's remarkable powerful for its size, and the battery lasts for quite a few hours.  I haven't timed it, but I use it every day for a couple of hours and I've only had to charge it about once a week.  My only complaint is that the smartphone app doesn't offer an equalizer function.  It may be available on more expensive models, but this one doesn't have it and it would be useful.  Still, at this price, it's a great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",There's a reason it's the baseline,5,"Baseline good speaker.  It's much much better than your phone speakers.  No wonder it was the most sold speaker for many years.  If I purchased again I would like to try the upgrade, but realistically it likely can't get much better for this size of a speaker; anything I might say about it is simply due to the physical limitations due to the size of the speaker (nobody wants to carry around a car speaker for jam sessions... duh)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","I bought it for the portability, but",5,"Mostly, I wanted something portable to take when camping or going on trips and this seem to have a reasonable price and good reviews so I bought one. The sound is even better than I expected, we are, of course, working with small speakers and limited power so at this size, I think this JBL is about optimal.  Wingstop, I can place it on top of the dash by the windshield and the acoustics are really nice,"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE IT,5,Absolutely love it. It's like having surround sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Almost perfect speaker that punches above its class (been using it almost daily for over a year now),5,"I've been using it almost daily for 20 minutes to 2 hours for almost 1 1/2 years now.SOUND: It sounds almost as good as a full blown stereo system, if not better depending on the stereo. The only thing that makes an actual stereo a little better is the fact the speakers aren't combined into one unit and the sound comes from multiple directions (but I'm tempted to get a 2nd one to fix that).The sub-woofers on the sides of this pack a significant punch at medium to high volumes, but still improve the sound even at low volumes. The sound is very full and never sounds ""tinny"" or even flat like smaller speakers usually do.It's stereo. I feel like I shouldn't have to mention this, but I do because the newer one isn't...BUILD QUALITY: The build quality is outstanding with almost no wear and tear even after a year of daily use and moving it around semi-frequently. The only real wear is a two or three hairline scratches where I slide it in and out of multiple times a day and honestly the fact it remained that way and isn't all scuffed up like I expected is amazing.The charging port door doesn't seem like it'll wear out anytime soon, nor do the jacks seem worn at all. I swing the thing by its carrying cord all the time and haven't seen any scratching or wear as a result and I have full confidence nothing bad will happen from doing so.BATTERY: The battery life for me was about 2 weeks when I got it and now it's down to 1 to 1/2 weeks, but I think I've been listening at higher volumes more recently and considering how quickly laptop batteries lose their charge, I think it's held up very well.CONS: There are a couple of bad things I've noticed. First of all, the highs are a little too high for my liking and its the kind of thing you really won't notice unless you listen to it all the time, especially at higher volumes. I solved this using the EQ on Spotify. Furthermore, while the bass sounds good by default I know it can do more, so I set the EQ accordingly. The other thing is really quiet songs at higher volumes reveal a really soft background static from the internal amplifier. This flaw is more than likely inherent to non-grounded amplifiers or ones without room for extra circuitry that can minimize it (but it seems pretty minimal already, so don't worry about this). To be honest, I thought the speaker was so perfect I was surprised it had any flaws.PHYSICAL DEVICE: It's waterproof and I've taken it to dusty and dirty places and washed it off just fine. The water can muffle the sound if it gets stuck on the speakers, but I've been able to shake it off half the time.It's pretty small in person, about the size of a 16oz water bottle and fits almost everywhere water bottles do which is very convenient for taking it everywhere. Compared to similar speakers it's smaller and sounds better.BLUETOOTH: It can handles 2 simultaneous phone connections and trade between them seamlessly whenever the other person starts to play something. I've had issues with 3+ people, but they had iPhones and I think that was the problem because I think I've done 3 Androids before without problems (but iPhones still work well up to 2 devices). Furthermore, the auto-connect only works when it's set for both headset and music, but since I don't enable headset I have to manually connect each time (but I think this is just my phone as other peoples usually auto-connect).Overall, I think this speaker is amazing, better than the older and newer ones, and much better than its competitors. I paid about $85 for this and think it was absolutely worth it, but it's cheaper now and I'm happy it's still available since I think it really is the best you can get for this category.(side note: the pictures are from when I got it, but it's looks almost the same but with the 2 or 3 tiny scratches where I slide it every day)"

 This prodigious product is beyond commendable, having withstood the rigors of consistent usage in a myriad of climatic conditions and serving as my quintessential speaker for an array of events. Astonishingly, despite being submerged in a pool for an entire day, it persevered and continues to project clear and resonant sound to this very day. Its unparalleled performance is nothing short of remarkable, and I am proud to attest to its enduring reliability. While there may be certain limitations in terms of sound quality, its cost-effective price point more than justifies its value as an exceptional investment. I have already recommended this speaker to many of my cohorts and I highly encourage you, the reader, to consider this an option as a portable speaker."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip 4,5,Amazing sound for such a small speaker.In the morning in the bathroom if you want to have a blast with the music you like to start the day in style ... get one of these.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",For the price?,5,C’mon. This is such a high quality speaker! Love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Little Speaker! Get multiple!,5,"I've had these for about 2 1/2 months....and all I can say is....Wow!! These are so much better than I expected!I bought 2 for stereo sound and they are astounding! I love them!!SOUND QUALITY:Fantastic!  It is amazing that sound this good comes from such small speakers. Great bass too.They make my ears happy...and the cost of them made my wallet happy too!! Win-win!LOUDNESS:I compared 2 different brand bluetooth speakers in a gym 72ft x 40ft.  I couldn't even hear the 1st test speaker. Then I tried the 2nd brand speaker JBL FLIP 4 and had no difficulty hearing it anywhere in the gym.  I then connected two JBL FLIP 4 speakers and the sound was amazing and it filled the gym.You can easily entertain with background music with these speakers.PHONE CONNECTIVITY:I wasn't planning on testing this feature. I didn't think I would use it and there was one review that said it didn't work that well anyway. Well fast forward, I had my phone connected to this speaker and was listening to music while showering and the phone & speaker started ringing. I pushed what I thought was the ignore phone call button on the speaker only to be met with silence from the speaker. I thought what is going on? I then thought let me say hello just to make sure I didnt answer the call. I said Hello and immediately was greeted by someone calling me on business. That was awkward and a little embarrassing. I apologized that I was in the shower. But did ask them if they could hear me okay. They said they could hear me just fine. So, I asked if I could call them back and a better time. So I guess that review saying it didnt work well was wrong. HahaBATTERY LIFE:I usually have my two JBL 4s bluetooth connected to each other AND my music device PLUS i have the speakers turned ALL THE WAY UP...and the battery life is good but not as good as I had read. I'm probably getting 7 hours +/- out of each one before I have to recharge them both.  But they recharge quickly and sound amazing!!PRODUCT QUALITY:The JBL Flip 4 feels really well made, not cheap in any way nor does it look or feel like they cut any corners when making it. It is sturdy and seems like it should last a long time.JBL CONNECT:Starting with the JBL FLIP 4 there is a new feature where other JBL FLIP 4's and newer JBL bluetooth speakers can connect to each other. You can connect up to 100 JBL speakers together for an incredible array of sound.COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPEAKERS:I watched a number of excellent bluetooth speaker reviews and read review articles before finally purchasing these speakers. I really enjoyed 2 YouTuber's video reviews, Oleg's Gadgets and JimsReviewRoom. The best review was on Oleg's Gagets Youtube Channel who played each speaker reviewed with the same song at the same volume level. He did a brilliant job!! You have to listen to his video review with headphones on to get the best sound quality and his audio recording of the speakers was SO GOOD that while he was off screen and walking across his hardwood floor to his couch, I whipped my head around because I thought someone was walking up behind me. I had to double check to make sure it was sound coming from his review and not my house. Lol.Enjoy hours of listening to these speakers!God bless!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Durable and loud,4,It’s a nice little speaker but it’s a bit heavy on the bass. The charge 4 is produces a much more balanced sound but the flip is nice and easier to take along to different places.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Great sound, portable, and pairs well with iPhones. Light weight for travel & golfing. Great for backyard parties."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,I did not expect it to sound so good for such a small speaker. It’s perfect for small or intimate settings
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Teachers! Great for the classroom,5,"I was looking for a classroom speaker that would pack a punch and fill the entire space. This speaker works great in my classroom which is fairly large. It can be turned up loud for presentations, and can be turned down to have study music going. The sound is rich and full. Would highly recommend for those teachers looking for something compact but powerful for their room."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,This speaker is worth the money. The battery lasts a long time and the speakers is very durable.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stop searching - 95% perfect speaker,5,"This summer I needed a new BT speaker and I tried a bunch of them in this size range and this one is by far my favorite.  It's about 95% perfect, which is about 50% better than all the others I tried.  It sounds AMAZING - it's among the loudest of the bunch, and it definitely has some of the best bass of them all thanks to the TWO side-mounted bass radiators.  It sounds better than all of the cheaper models, as well as better than most of the more expensive models.  Probably the SONOS and Bose Soundlink Mini sound better, but they are considerably more expensive and are not waterproof.  That's the thing - the FLIP 4 checks pretty much every box except two, which are relatively minor flaws.  I wanted something rugged, with a decent battery, good controls, great sound, and that was not too bulky.  Probably what we are all looking for.PROS:Form factor - the beer-can size and shape is the best for carrying around.  The attached lanyard makes it even better, as you can hang it or swing it.Sound - incredibly rich, best-in-class bass, and great definition all around.  Gets loud, too.Build quality - this thing is waterproof and dustproof, and feels pretty indestructibeBT controls/features - easy-to-use buttons control volume, music, and speakerphone, as well as letting you link multiple JBL speakers.  Newest BT version (4.2)Battery - lasts all day, supposedly 12 hours, but varies by usage - and I've yet to have a problemCONS:No REW/Previous track.  This is what bothers me the most, I just don't understand why this isn't implemented somewhere.Directional, rather than 360-degree sound.  Not sure if I care.Other speakers I compared this to were the Marley Chant, two different iHome speakers, an old Bose Soundlink Mini, a Philips Shoqbox, something by OutdoorTech, a Magnavox speaker, and the UE Boom2.  I also spent way too much time researching other models online.  All of them had more shortcoming than this one - most just sounded worse or were underpowered, many were not waterproof or had lousy batteries, or no music controls.  Only a few let you link multiple speakers together.The speaker I bought first was the UE BOOM 2, because it gets the best reviews.  It costs at least $50 more than this and does not sound as clear.  It is a little more stylish I guess, and has a similar app to the JBL and is well supported by firmware and software updates.  However, it uses a stupid ""tap"" system to pause and FF (also no REW) that rarely worked.  The JBL has nice big buttons that work great.  Dedicated volume buttons control speaker/source volume, and double-pressing the play button skips a track.  I would LOVE a REW feature, a triple tap would do it, but I can ultimately live without it.  Ultimately, the UE BOOM 2 was not worth the extra money - it sounded worse in most situations (it was possibly louder and has 360-degree sound), and was infuriating to control.None of the cheaper speakers sounded better than this.  There was one, the MagicBox I think, that was louder than all of them and has awesome buttons for volume and music, but it's not waterproof at all.  The Fugoo looks amazing but it is only 6 Watts total, which is never going to be loud enough for anything other than a personal speaker.There are bigger speakers out there that have additional features like external charging and last for 24 hours at a time and pump out considerably more decibels, but they are also too big to fit my needs.  Honestly this one is nearly perfect, and maybe they can add REW in the future via an update and get it 100% right."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great Sound,4,"For a relatively low-end speaker this has great sound quality. Four rather than five stars because there is no indicator as to when the battery is fully, or better yet, mostly charged. That said, I would buy it again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Live my little speaker!,5,Nice and loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I gave it a 10.,5,It is perfect for me.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Good quality sound, practical and easy to set up"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s a JBL so I have no worries,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is amazing. I was going to get one of those cheaper speakers but I knew I would only disappoint myself in the long run so I just went for it. You should too, you won’t regret it. Comes with a cute red charger."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Great,4,Use at work and connects easy as Bluetooth speaker to phone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can't go wrong,5,Excellent product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",worth every cent,5,"sounds better than my $200 sound bar and has better volume control. perfect size for travel and easy to clean despite having the white colored speaker. don't waste your money on a cheaper speaker even if it is half the cost of this one; the quality is exponentially greater and worth the price. i'd pay $20 more for this speaker, but the price they ask for for this model 4 is such a steal since the model 5 is out now!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend,5,I love the clear well-balanced sound quality of this  speaker.  It's better than my UE Megaboom speaker which it's replacing.  Five stars all the way around.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This  speaker pounds freaking good now I can hear where my  money went.,5,
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The device volume keeps decreasing... once I turn it up it goes down,4,"I will be honest, the sound quality is excellent, easy to connect but I realized that after a while it disconnects every now and again, I've used different devices to see if my phone was the issue but I realized that it wasn't. The other issue is that the volume decreases by itself every now and again, sometimes when I'm increasing the volume it turns it down to 0 immediately after or while I'm turning it up."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfecta,4,Súper le doy un 10 de 10
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Optimal sound quality,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Amazing sound quality, I bought this for my trip to Florida! Glad I bought this, here's a video of the sound quality!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Make sure to go over your Amazon purchase carefully thx.,5,I wanted the bigger speakers not these but that's ok that's my fault for not going over my order. I'll get the bigger JBL speakers next pay day thx.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good but…,4,My husband got this to replace our larger JBL speaker but regretting it now. Sound quality is good and battery life is long but we use the speaker in our hot tub and don’t bring our cell phones in and the location of the controls to turn up or down the sound and to forward to another song are on the bottom vs the top. Hard to find in the dark and not a convenient location overall. Wish we would have returned to get the larger speaker. We had our larger speaker for about 5 years and it won’t charge now. Not happy about that either. Seems a speaker should last longer than that before having to be replaced.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Sound,5,Really easy to use for sound amplification.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",U can connect them but I don’t advice it,3,I had 1. It’s super nice. So nice I decided to get a 2nd one. BIG MISTAKE.  I have a hard time keeping both playing wt out interference from some other device unrelated to mines.  N if I turn the music off for less then 10 minutes it’s a b**** to get them to play again. Over all not a good experience like when I only had 1.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker jams hard.,5,I love the sound quality and the ease with which I can toggle between earbuds and the player. Very easy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!!,5,"I love this speaker, it’s so loud and good quality of music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",5 is BETTER,4,"These are great but for some reason the 5 isn’t available: they do fail after a year or so if used a lot. Still, the sound quality is pretty good for the price and I use mine all the time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,This speaker is awesome. I work at home and it's great to play music on.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and great speaker,5,"I bought this speaker originally as a present for my sister's iPod use. All through December we played Christmas music everywhere in the house for hours on end (without a plug and using bluetooth). It worked great. The sound was loud as our stereo and very clear. No hums or metallic sounds.At Christmas this year, I bought 2 more, for a laptop with a lousy speaker system and an mpg player with a book on tape. Both the quiet spoken word and low-woofer symphonic music sounds perfect on this device. I highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is SUPER GREAT!,5,Can’t go wrong with JBL!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 Speaker.,5,"Update July 11 2020I haven't even used this speaker up until recently. The battery is only lasting about 4 hrs. I bought my son one before I bought mine and his last about 12 hrs. He uses his a lot. I'm really bummed out and I paid more for mine than I did his. Bought from this same place.Update June 25,2019:You are suppose to be able  To connect up to a 100 speakers with the JBL connect app.  My son is here and I tried connecting both of them and it doesn't work it just keep spinning and says discovering. They are both connected to Bluetooth in my phone. But it won't even pick up just one speaker. Any suggestions?I just recieved this today. So this is an out of box review. I will update later on batterie life and usage durability Etc.I bought this for my son for Christmas. Tried it out and I'm very impressed! It paired up quickly and easily to my phone. I played music through my samsung music app. Most music apps have a equalizer in them so you can make adjustments on the bass and treble. So those that have concerns... problem solved. The sound was pretty loud for such a small speaker.  I like that you can pair up more than one speaker. Because you can set the speakers in different rooms of the house and have music in every room and not have to worry about hearing it just from one speaker.I live in a small two-bedroom condo now so I had to take down my Mackie SRM 450 speakers and my equipment. I own a karaoke and DJ business. I have a really nice Bose SoundDock that I've been using for just everyday listening but it's heavy and bigger to take over to the pool. It's not waterproof and you can't hook up more speakers. This JBL Flip 4 is lightweight compact you can take it over to the pool and not have to worry about it getting wet because it's waterproof. I have not been able to test that but I have seen other reviews where that has been tested and they do prove to be waterproof. You can take it anywhere. It will fit in your purse.Bluetooth is probably the best technology that's ever come out. No more wires or cables.  And I can play the music that's on my phone and walk anywhere around the house I want with my phone or tablet because I'm not connected to the speaker. For the money this was a fantastic deal and well worth it. I've always been a fan of JBL speakers for centuries. I think they really outdid themselves with this. Now I want to buy some for myself. I also bought him a hard shelled carrying case for the speaker and his accessories the USB cable and the plug. The plug does not come with it but if you own a smartphone you probably already have one. And you can also buy just a plug. You could possibley use a USB charging cable in your car as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good thing come in little packages,4,Love the built in handle.  Great sound comes from this portable speaker.  Indoor or outdoor
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doesn't Dual Connect,4,I am normally able to connect 2 Bluetooth devices on my phone. So I play the same music upstairs as I play on my downstairs system. This speaker wouldn't allow the dual connection as a prior JPL did.  That was a disappointment.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfied customer,5,Probably the best Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned the sound is rich and I love the red color!! Couldn’t have selected a better one and the price was very affordable ????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect size amazing overall,5,amazing quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The only speaker i’ll ever need,5,"words cannot express how in love i am with this speaker. it’s absolutely amazing, it sounds good, it connects to my phone instantly, and it’s portable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's Worth it.,4,"Clear sound and love base, quick connection, long life of battery. However, it is so round when it is lay flat rolling way."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Terrific speaker at its price point.,5,"My sense is that there is no limit to the amount of money people can spend on sound systems and wine, so I am reviewing this speaker with the caveat that it fit my budget for the purpose I want it.  Could I wish it had a little more bass?  Sure, especially when playing the blues.  But even then, some blues recordings are rich enough to sound just fine with this speaker, and the other blues recordings are good enough.  But when playing classical and jazz, I really have no complaints.  I find it attractive, easily portable (I bought a carrying case and insured it as well, for extra peace of mind) and it allows me to hear and share all the music I have on my iPhone.  I also found it very easy to link via bluetooth.  I'm very pleased!  If I have trouble with the battery, I'll add to this review."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Product!,5,"My kids recommended I get this JBL speaker so I could hear the computer while I worked around the house.  I actually managed to get it to recognize the computer (I so don't understand this electronic stuff) and, WOW, was I impressed.  The sound is fantastic!  Both music and voice is totally different from the pathetic computer speakers!  I can use it in my studio, downstairs, anywhere in the house and it never loses the connect to my computer!  The unit feels solid and substantial and I think it'll last a long, long time.  Thinking of getting another ...the kids say it'll be like surround sound!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Ended up buying four of them.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great gift!,5,My boyfriend loves this speaker the sound quality is amazing and it’s reasonably priced
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound on the go With Mic,5,"Love the sound. Crisp clean instruments, deep base. Love the built in microphone for incoming calls when outside or at the beach. Love the size, its light weight, easy to carry and easy to toss into a backpack or attach to a kayak.  Its waterproof so it's great by a pool or floating on the river. I love that it floats so when I dropped it off my raft it was easy to find.  Nice color choice.  I chose white because it's really easy to see everywhere.  I like that it can connect with other Flips but I haven't done that yet. This is really a nice speaking for most anywhere,  I really like it a lot all!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip Bass isn't as good as the Charge,3,"I compared the JBL Flip to the JBL Charge. The Charge has a greater deeper bass tone than the Flip. If you're into the bass, I would not recommend the Flip."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud,5,Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AWESOME,5,"I've always just bought a $50 bluetooth speaker, something cheap. But I always lose it when I travel. So after losing like 3, I decided to invest in a better one. Something I'll remember not to lose. It's great. Very good quality. You cannot compare this to the cheap bluetooth speakers. Trust the JBL brand!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life NOT even close to what was described,3,Battery life is very disappointing.Fully charged and the battery only lasted a fraction of the time as indicated in the description of this speaker. It says 12 hours of battery life and I got maybe 4 hours of battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s decent enough,4,It’s lightweight and sounds good but it’s still not a Bose but is same price. The charger plug fits very snug and I like that part as some others break off  easily.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It sounds great,5,Love that you can bump the volume and it sounds great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works better than I expected.,5,It connects easily and has an app so you can change the name and do some other stuff that I wasn’t really interested in. I charged it once since I received it about two and a half weeks ago and it’s still playing just fine. I have it next to my shower and use it while I’m in there.It sounds great and hasn’t disappointed me yet. I bought it to replace a different brand set up I had since it quit charging after 5 months. Guess I should have gone with this one first and saved myself some money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,Some songs are not in stereo
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound quality - Better than Bose,5,"I'm very picky about sound quality.  I like crisp highs, and tight (rather than boomy) lows.  After listening to one of these, I felt it performed better than the Bose Soundlink Revolve II that was more than twice the cost.  Even at high volumes, I have not suffered from listening fatigue. Batter life is also excellent.  Highly recommended."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use good quality Bluetooth speaker,5,"Love the sound quality & Bluetooth range. I use it mostly just around my house & usually keep the volume “low” but it’s able to get pretty loud which is nice to have as an option. All in all, I’m very very happy with this purchase & would buy again. Battery life could be a little longer, but I also listen to a music a lot, so it’s not too big of a deal."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Annoying,3,This speaker is so damn annoying because if you’re 4-5ft away the music will get so choppy. If you have someone stand in between you and the speaker while they’re holding their phone? Choppy.I wouldn’t recommend this speaker. Get something better.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",buen articulo,5,excelente bocinas la uso mucho para la playa
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good things come in small packages,5,"The sound quality on these are awesome, but it's to be expected from JBL. We love to bring ours to the beach because even with all the wind and sea noise we can hear our music clearly. Quality product that I will likely buy again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Quality Product,5,"This product is not large, thus it has a limited range. But JBL has outstanding quality within the world of sound and music and this product provides my family just what we need. It’s perfect for a one or a two bedroom apartment and has the ability to properly spread sound within an area of around that size. It may not afford you the connectivity of an Echo or a similar device, but it provides you with what you need within the area of sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip,3,Doesn't have the output that I thought it would have
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,"The speakers in my car went out, and this is a great substitute. Good base, surround sound and noise canceling."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worse sound quality than the JBL Flip 3? How?,3,"I had a JBL Flip 2 and loved it, so I bought a JBL Flip 3 and also loved it! I also have friends who own the JBL Charge and the JBL Pulse, and I've always been impressed by those models as well. So, when the JBL Flip 4 came out, and I saw its price is so affordable, I went ahead and bought it because it never hurts to have a few (one in my office, one in the RV, one in the living room, etc).I bought the Ocean Blue color, which I was impressed with as soon as I opened it. The color is beautiful; dark, deep, and unassuming, but also different and unique. I really love the color. My first impression was that the Flip 4 felt heavier than my Flip 3, and I was excited to hear the quality of the sound, because I was sure JBL was continuing to innovate and improve their flagship bluetooth speaker...But I was stunned. When I first started a song, it would sound great. That's because the beginning of most songs are very ""thin"", meaning there's only a few things going on at a time, allowing the speaker to dedicate its full capacity to the one or two sounds happening. But when the song became ""busy"", meaning there were more layers, the audio became muddy, the bass went away completely, and the clarity I love so much about my Flip 3 isn't there at all.The song I first noticed it on is ""Happy Pills"", by Paul Leonard-Morgan (from the ""Limitless"" movie soundtrack). The song sounds great on the Flip 4 for the first 55 seconds, but the clarity and bass drops noticeably at the 1-minute mark (when additional sounds are added), and drops noticeably again at 1:15 when the song really hits its stride. Listening to this song on the JBL Flip 3 sounds great, but listening to it on my new Flip 4 is beyond disappointing.How did the sound quality decline with the newer model? The newer model should have improved sound quality, isn't that the reason you release a newer model? If not for improved sound quality, then the sound quality should at least remain the same but the device have improved battery life or bluetooth connectivity, right?Unfortunately I have to report that while the battery life may have improved, the improvement is marginal, and not worth it at all if that's the tradeoff for sound quality. The bluetooth connectivity seems to be the same as my Flip 3; I don't notice any difference at all.I started trying to use the JBL Connect app to play music on multiple Flip speakers at once, but I think that system has too many bugs and glitches in it that need to be fixed. I can't get it to work right for me, but I'll keep trying. If you're buying this SOLELY for the ability to link multiple speakers, you might want to look elsewhere until JBL improves this functionality substantially.I hope JBL releases an update for the JBL Flip 4 that will improve the audio quality, and I hope JBL fixes all the issues with the JBL Connect system. At this point, my faith in JBL and my love for their previous products is the only reason that I'm not returning this speaker.Note: I'm attempting to write more reviews on Amazon because I'm seeing more and more evidence of fake reviews on Amazon. I wish Amazon would do more to combat fake reviews. If you see a product on Amazon with over a thousand reviews and over 4.5 stars, please be wary and use sites like FakeSpot and/or ReviewMeta. No idea how accurate these fake review tools are, but I figure it can't hurt. Thanks for reading!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Works great, sounds great",5,"Bought this to keep in my bathroom so I could listen to music as I shower, as my phone isn’t loud enough and the speaker I used to have in there kept turning on and off by itself when it’s supposed to be off.The sound quality of this is much better than my old Bluetooth speaker was and has a higher max volume which is great as it can get loud enough for me to hear it clearly over the running water of the shower and the bathroom fan.It was easy to set up the Bluetooth on it as well to pair to my phone, & I’ve had no issues reconnecting to it the numerous times I’ve turned it on and off.Definitely a great purchase for my uses"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Everything as advertised ??,5,"the connectivity speed is great and i can use it in the shower without having to worry about ruining it, it’s a pretty bassy and loud speaker which is always enjoyable"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","10/10 For reasons, etc...",5,"My Flip 3 died a slow and painful death, so I had to buy a new one. Deciding between the flip 4 and 5 wasn't too difficult. I'm a musician, so when I found out the Flip 5 played only in mono it was an instant deal-breaker.The Flip 4 is durable, waterproof, and very loud. I need to turn the volume down to just 3 clicks at work to keep it low enough so my boss can't hear it from his office. However, I blast it literally everywhere else I go. My car stereo is broken so I just set this thing on my dash and it powers through the noise of my open window going 80 up and down the HWY 101. I sing in the shower and it does a great job of overpowering my terrible voice, even when drenched in water, so that's a plus (I'm a drummer, not a singer). I also set it on my hood while washing my carblast week and the whole neighborhood could hear me blasting everything from metal to deep blues to K-pop. I'm just kidding, I don't listen to K-pop.The Bluetooth works well. Almost too well... I was in my car on my break and left the thing sitting on my desk. I was trying to watch a YouTube video of how to jailbreak an iPhone (idk why, I hate apple products) and I couldn't figure out why my audio wasn't working. I cranked my phone all the way up and still nothing. Turns out I left the Bluetooth on and my whole office's ears were bleeding from the blaring voice of Linus from ""Linus Tech Tips"".I recommended this speaker to my friend so she bought one, and linking them together is very useful. If you set two of them back to back in the middle of a room, the sound just fills the room completely, which I'm sure will be great for parties or social gatherings once we can have those again. (If you're reading this in the future and covid is finally been long over and you have no clue what I'm talking about, look it up, it's awful (yes, I'm bored (go look at newer speakers, there's probably a Flip 9 by now, jeez))).Anyways...10/10 Good Purchase"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"Great sound, battery life and features.  The ability to attach to more than one speaker is great for surround sound!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it! Just upgraded from the Flip 3,5,"I have always been a JBL fan. I love the brand. So it's no surprise that I decided to upgrade to the Flip 4. Where to begin?First. The sound is great, for a portable speaker it really fills a room! My partner loves having it in the kitchen when he is washing the dishes, and I can hear the music through the house at a quality level (whether I want to or not ha!) I use it when I am in my studio painting, and can place it anywhere and still get great sound!Second. The color I picked is beautiful. Truly, the dark teal color is awesome! I always love darker colors since you can't see how dirty they are over time like lighter colors. It also helps me find it easier when I eventually always lose track of it. I can't help it, I lose things easily, but the color helps me find it right away!Third. Design. It feels more sleek and sturdy from the previous design of the Flip 3. I really love how they keep improving. The design sets the tone for the sound quality of this product. The charging port area is covered up but easy to access. Next to the charging port is an AUX connection for those that can't connect via Bluetooth. Connection to the device is easy as well, and always easy to pair new devices to it. The charging port is the same as my samsung phone charger so I can switch them out really easily if I misplace one or the other. (and like I said before, I misplace things easily)Fourth. JBL in general is awesome. They have MANY designs of speakers that ALL connect to each other!! How awesome is that?!??! When I get together with my family, we all bring our JBL speakers and connect them all to place around the house. That way we can play one song throughout the entire house. This keeps a party connected and going.Other random things about it. It's water resistant, so having it by the pool or at the beach during the summer is hassle free. The price is affordable, especially compared to most portable speakers with less reliability.Pros:-Sturdy-Reliable-Great color-Awesome Sound QualityCons:-Honestly, can't find any."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lil speaker,5,"Got this as a Xmas present for my girlfriend, was amazed at how loud and clear the music sounds out of this little thing. No more complaints from the neighbors when i F her brains out, just conplaints about the music being too loud. Highly recommend this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,"Excellence. Sound, quality, durability & I love that it’s waterproof."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",probably defective unit,3,"Battery life was no longer than 2 hours, probably defective unit."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Quality,5,This is such a great speaker! I absolutely love the quality and the sound overall. It also holds a long battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker at This Price Point,5,"Sound quality is so subjective I want to review other aspects of the speaker and in comparison with comparably priced Anker Sound Boost. The reason is I was leaning toward the JBL Flip 4 but was researching Amazon to see if there were better options.  There were a number of reviews for Anker that rated it superior to Flip 4, some from people professing to be experts or audiophiles. I took a chance and originally purchased the Anker, returned the next day and bought the Flip 4.  I don;t profess to be either an expert or audiophile but I've bought many Wireless Speakers ranging from cheap to Beats and Bose.  When I opened the Anker I was disappointed. The USB charging cable was obviously flimsy and cheap and the documentation even cheaper appearing. I had charge issues right off the bat and tried to contact support. In the interim I learned from web research that charging issues are not uncommon and that the manufacturer recommends using a different (higher quality) charging cable as the first remedy. I also learned that the instruction manual is incorrect and that the manufacturer is familiar with both problems yet continue to ship the speakers with these two inadequate components!  I did connect the Anker to a couple of my devices and the Bluetooth connection was quick and easy. Both the range and sound quality were less than I expected. And, when I connected to my High Resolution Sony Digital player the volume control of the player was disabled.  I researched that problem and found that it is a known issue when the Sony is connected to some lower quality Bluetooth devices.The JBL Flip 4 arrived professionally packaged (as expected) with a robust USB charging cable and separately packaged, professionally printed and ACCURATE instructions.  Initial charge was quick and as documented. Bluetooth connection is also quick and easy.  Range is probably at least as good as advertised and way better than the Anker. All controls of my connected devices (i.e. Sony player volume, etc.) work perfectly. Sound quality is subjective but that along with volume, bass, etc. it certainly meets my expectations and certainly is superior to Anker Sound Boost.  JBL and Harman Kardon are brands that music lovers know they can trust and they continue to deliver.  This is probably the best Bluetooth Speaker you can buy for under $100.  I only share this in case someone else is considering the Flip 4 and checking out the options.  Please don't get fooled by reviews of some competitors, especially those who use JBL Flip 4 in unfavorable comparison. Of course we all buy speakers for the sound not for the packaging or accessories or printed material but if those things are inferior it's pretty indicative of what to expect with the main product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for music while golfing,5,"This speaker is great for out on the course, attached to the cart"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound But Weal Battery Life,4,This JBL Speaker packs quit a punch. The bass is very strong and blue tooth connectivity is impressive. I was disappointed that I bough two of these and within 12 months both batteries wouldn't hold a charge anymore. I would find another speaker to purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It has great bass,5,"I liked this speaker a lot. It had amazing battery life and was great to take in the shower, rain, pool, and more. I really enjoyed this speaker and would most definitely buy more from JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Was a gift and quality was great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound,5,"The Flip 4 is an outstanding Bluetooth speaker. Easy to connect and excellent battery life. When they are paired in stereo, they sound like a decent home system. The JBL app can be a bit inconsistent at times, but the speakers will eventually connect together. Since JBL has introduced the Flip 5 and Flip 6, the price on the Flip 4 has been reduced. A good purchase for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL is currently at the top of the food chain,4,What more is there to say  JBL is JBL
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Exceeded expectations,5,This is a great speaker.  Seriously we love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pefect,5,"I've been using this speaker at work to play holiday music.  It is perfect. The sound, quality, very long battery life.  Everyone loves it. So happy I made this purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice,4,great sound... wrong color they sent me as well as cord too...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jbl craftsmanship at its best,4,Just simply love it and lives up to its jbl name!!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Me encanto es pequeña fácil de llevar a todos lados,5,Me encanta el sonido de esta bosons
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfaction,5,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband.We’re both very happy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommended!,5,Awesome sound and super simple connection. We will see how this holds up but my dad recommended this after long time use and I have great faith in it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality sound from a small box.,5,Great sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is better than I imagined,5,"After researching countless reviews I arrived at the JBL Fllip4; one particular review submitted by D L titled ""Bluetooth Speaker Comparison - 2017 edition"" helped me make my final decision.The speaker arrived earlier than promised (big thumbs uo to the seller).I immediately opened the package and checked the contents, I then started to read the instruction booklet and quickly tossed them aside (It takes longer to find the language that you read than it does to start playing with the buttons); The controls are very user friendly and easy to learn. Pairing the device is very simple; if you have ever paired a bluetooth device you will have this mastered in a second, if not then just ask any 7 year old and they can show you.After pairing with my Samsung phone I turned on my Amazon music play list and the sound that came out of this speaker was incredible. Everyone has their own taste as to how music should sound but this is perfect for me. I started playing everything from Lady Antibellum to Rush to Pink Floyd, everything was excellent. I decided to hop into the hot tub and listen to music for a while with the speaker sitting on my patio table. While in the hot tub it started to rain unexpectedly, no problem at all the speaker is waterproof just like they said.There are certain songs that just have to be played wide open like Meatloafs ""bat out of Hell"" and Prince's ""Purple Rain"". I can crank these songs all the way up with no distortion whatsoever.To sum up my review: I would highly recommend this speaker, if you have made it this far into my review then go ahead and click on the ""Buy it Now"" link."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's a great speaker well worth the money.,5,I like to disease setup and easily use. I have an old truck with no radio at all and I like that I can set it on my dash And listen to the music from my cell phone and rock on the street.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is short,4,"It advertises 12 hours battery life , it only last 2 hours or less"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great affordable bluetooth speaker!,5,I got the flip 4 when it first came out. I beat the heck out of it for 4 years and it still works great! When I saw the price for a new one I couldn't pass it up. So that is my garage radio now and my new one will be my go to speaker for golf/fishing trips/back yard fires.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My go to speaker,5,"Works like a charm. I carry it around everywhere and the sound is strong, quality and has great bass. Charges quickly and battery life is long."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4,4,"What I didn't like are the instructions being so small that only a lillipution from Gulliver's Travels could read. Other than that, it is an excellent bluetooth speaker??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really great if you travel.,5,Sound is great. It is as good as advertised.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JB!!!!!!!!!,5,very good very nice
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from this speaker!,5,Unbelievable sound from this speaker and volume range is huge! JBL quality is excellent as expected.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just order it!,5,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He loved it!  The sound is awesome!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works Great!,5,Love my new speaker - it sounds great and looks great - battery lasts forever.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Very small, easy to transport, great sound"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great product, but will not connect to MacBook Pro 2020 with Intel chip",5,"Is there *any* bluetooth speaker that is compatible with a 13"" 2020 Macbook Pro with Intel chips? I cannot get a straight answer out of Apple."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Little Package, Huge, Clear Sound!",5,"PROSBIG SOUND: This little gizmo gives clean, clear sound across the entire frequency range, including plenty of bass. If you need volume, it will give you quite a bit, and if you run several together (see the JBL web site for specs and capabilities), you could greatly increase the coverage area. Several of these might make an excellent compact wireless speaker system, as long as you start with fully charged batteries and remember the power limitations of each unit - 16 watts (8 X 2) maximum.FEATURES -  Some of JBL's larger and smaller models don't have all of the features this one has, like audio input jack, speakerphone capability, etc., so those are nice plusses for this model.SO-SOsBATTERY LIFE: I have no idea if it will live up to JBL's claims as I just got it, but if it even comes close, I will be happy. If you use it near a USB power source, you can keep the USB cable plugged in and extend the life of the charge. I have this Flip 4 and also a GO 2, and neither came with a charger, but since the world is being overrun by USB chargers, that's probably a good thing. They each came with the USB cable.VULNERABILITY: Inside each end of the tube is a resonator that acts to enhance the low frequencies, and they do a good job, but they appear to be as compliant and delicate as exposed speaker cones. For that reason I wish the designers had included a protective grille over each end. I might try to make my own. Other than that, the case seems quite rugged.CONSOther than the Caution above, I haven't found any yet. A couple of minor things - it is a stereo system, but with the speakers so close together, the separation is hard to hear. However, it is definitely a more open sound than you would get if you were running both channels through one speaker. Also, the power button requires a stronger and more centered push than most, and at first I thought mine was defective.Yes, I would enthusiastically recommend this to anyone looking for a small wireless speaker system."

 Honestly, the price hits hard but combining it’s looks, sound quality, seamless bluetooth and battery life. It’s almost hard not to buy a JBL speaker for this price for on the go.First mentioning I got the camo edition but that does not change how the speaker works. Unlike the flip 3 stealth.Sound quality is precise. It hits hard on bass, not too much but enough to leave plenty of room for the lows, mids, and the highs which is exactly how it should be. Distortion is little to none, and most occurs on songs with already distorted sounds that just don’t take advantage of what JBL does best.Bluetooth is seamless like mentioned, you push the power, it go’s to pairing than you link up and your set! Although, if you plan on using the party feature, while charging your speaker it wouldn’t be a bad idea to download the app and update the speaker as it’s most likely outdated like mine was.Than battery life. I’ve seen coworkers go days on a single charge but that’s with on off use. Daily use it can handle quite a punch, almost 6 hours on a full charge if I remember correctly, probably more if your really hammering it.The party-mode feature needs some work, it’s range from speaker to speaker is very limited. I would range it to no more than 8ft approximately. It also drops signal occasionally with the paired speaker for party-mode and picks back up even within range. But still needs refinementThe video I posted does not sound well as it has to run through my phone. Although their is plenty of audiophile reviews out there that demonstrate the Flip4’s ability.Thanks for reading my review!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound in a small package,5,"Sound is amazing, sounds rich and deep, way more than what you'd expect for something not much bigger than a beer can. Bluetooth connectivity was excellent. The only possible glitch was no charger was provided and the instructions for setup and use were absolutely useless and I had to go to Google to get usable setup instructions. But once that was out of the way, I had a really excellent speaker. I didn't rate battery life as I haven't had it long enough to rate that."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can stand the weather,5,"Got this for the roommates birthday a few years ago. He likes to crack a few and hit the porch and sleep outside at night. This thing is out there with him almost every night. It does the job. Gets pretty damn loud for its size and carries well. Decent bass and overall sound. I mean, it is what it is and it ain’t what it ain’t. It is convenient, very nice quality sound that is going to be hard to beat for on-the-go needs inside a portable unit. Parks, beaches, bbq’s, camping, a day on the beach or mountain…this is your huckleberry. A substitute for a good home stereo it ain’t.If the former is your aim, this will be perfect for that. Super portable and the pairing features are easy and solid. Overall a great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good speaker, JBL app is a bit wonky",4,"Sounds good with enough bass for its' size.  The bass is just average - mixes well with mid/highs but won't impress most.  It's loud enough for most listening activities, but not for that great song you just want to crank it up.I bought 2 JBL Flip 4's for proper stereo sound (left-only on the left speaker, right-only on the right speaker).  The Party button/mode is no-brainer easy, but each speaker plays both L/R stereo channels which is annoying when you want true stereo.The JBL app is kinda wonky.  You have to stop any other music/apps or else it's super slow to discover the Flip 4 (if it ever does).  You have to wait until all speakers are truly discovered AND report the green battery-strength bar (up to 30 seconds).  If you're impatient it just won't work.  It's not intuitive that you only pair *1* primary speaker with Bluetooth, and rely on the party-mode button for this primary speaker to connect to the other.The app is the only way to get 2 speakers into true stereo mode, but if you do much of anything else on your phone it ""forgets"" and the speakers switch back to party mode.  Also when your music app starts a new song, it first plays on the primary speaker then takes ~5 seconds to start playing on the secondary.  On movie night I use 1/8"" cables and a special L/R splitter because I can't rely on the app+bluetooth.So, minus 1/2 star for the volume/bass, and another 1/2 star for the lame app."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Workout aide,5,Great for my workouts and when I'm cooking
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and battery life,5,Love everything about it use it at the pool and beach.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4,5,The sound is awesome and it was really easy to connect to my phone I already have a flip 5
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice little speaker,4,"If I didn’t have a JBL Charge 3 to compare it to (based strictly on max volume) I’d love it even more. It’s lightweight, smaller than I expected - and has excellent battery life. It’s just not as loud as the JBL Charge 3."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Batería no es muy durable,5,No es muy durable la batería
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality and sound at a good price!,5,"I have enjoyed this speaker! First the Pros:- Sound quality is great with nice bass for its size- Very durable and water resistance is great- Battery life is quite good- Portability.. You can take it almost anywhere easily- JBL connect is easy and a great featureThe cons (if you want to call them that):- Although sound quality is great, it starts to suffer at higher volumes, loss of bass and a bit of distortion- Not quite as loud as I would have liked. I use this on my Side X Side and most of the time it sounds just fine but when really revving at high speed it gets drowned out by engine noise. Most trail riding, however, it performs well. Adding a second speaker with JBL connect has helped drastically.  I have used these speakers on a regular basis and have to say I love them. On the porch, around a fire, camping, traveling, etc. Having the ability to connect several of these and spread them out over a large area makes for great flexibility. Just two of them in my large yard allows for lower volume with sound covering a large area that is easy to hear, as opposed to cranking just one speaker and having a ""loud"" area near the speaker where you can't have conversation. I have had them out riding, covered in dust and dirt, splashed with water, and seen globs of mud splashed on them. A damp cloth cleans them up nicely. I have dropped, kicked, and bobbled them all over without negative side effect. The connectivity range seems to be quite good, I have never had connectivity issues.  My opinion? You should buy this, and you will likely buy at least a second one like I did. Enjoy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product!,5,"Sounds better than the Bose Bluetooth speaker, which is why we went with this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Exceptional quality in design, build, and sound.",5,"Exceptional quality in design, build, and sound. This speaker feels like my Mercedes Benz.  I was shocked to find this level of quality in a sub-hundred dollar bluetooth speaker. Also it was VERY well packaged by JBL. I would say the packaging was as good if not better than an Apple Macbook Pro.  Nice touch.I’ve been using the box it came in to transport it inside my backpack until my daily use nylon case arrives.Pairing this speaker to my iPhone and my two Lenovo laptops and a Macbook Pro was super easy. I actually haven’t opened the manual for this thing- Maybe because I watched about a dozen video reviews comparing this to the equivalent class models feom Sony, Beats, and Bose.I actually bought another one(In blue) prior to mine(gray), for my son as a birthday gift. But it’s not for another couple months. My curiosity was killing me, because I enjoyed watching all these reviews, so I went ahead and used my AMEX points and sought immediate gratification for myself. Depraved, I know.Anyway, this speaker is nothing short of outstanding. I listen to everything from Masta Ace and Eric B. & Rakim, to Testament, Joe Satriani, to Mozart and Chopin. Throw in some Steelie Dan, Elvis and Bluegrass in there as well. This speaker handles all of that, in a satisfying way. I’ve been using this daily on my desk at the office, to help me deal with the long hours behind the computer.I’ve been having to use my Flip 4 in secret, so my son doesn’t see or hear it, until he receives his blue Flip 4 for his birthday. Then I can finally take mine out in the open and have him try out the multi-speaker pairing feature. That will be very neat.Very proud of my JBL bluetooth speaker. I think I will try one of the larger models in our boat.It was a tough decision between this flip 4 or the Sony SES-XB20. But I ikes the more durable feel of the JBL. The Sony sounded absolutely killer, though. But I figured since my son wanted the Flip 4, I should probably get something similar so we could pair them later on.Also I might have a bias toward JBL because I have JBL speakers in my Lenovo Y700 and Yoga 920, which listen to, a lot, while working.I’ve also got a pair of JBL LT-100 speakers for the home stereo. From back when JBL wasn’t owned by Harmon Kardon/now Samsung.JBL brand still makes an exceptional product. Well done!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect sound,5,Great choice quality sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Wow, the sound is incredible",5,"Such a small speaker, but deep, rich bass and good treble. Perfect for connecting to your iPad in bed or in the bathroom/shower for music or videos. The battery lasts about 8-10 hours on full blast, which is a bonus. Get it, you’ll be surprised!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, not so great battery life.",4,"The sound quality is very good for a speaker this size. When I turn it on first time each day, Bluetooth connection is great. If I shut it off during the day and turn it back on a few minutes later, getting it connected again is a struggle. Battery life is not that great. 3 to 4 hours and that's not with the volume all the way up either. I see a newer version is out, might pick up one and see if any improvements were made."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT SPEAKER!!,5,"This is my new favorite speaker to use on the go. I love whenever I bump Lil baby, Drake, or 21 Savage. You can hear every little detail. Great battery life. Was able to listen to the new Taylor Swift album on repeat for about 12 hours."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worthy of the five star rating.,5,"In a word, excellent. Solid build, fantastic sound, and pretty decent battery life. I have this one and a family member has the next model down and both are built and sound with the same level of craftsmanship. It’s rare to find a solid five star rating on Amazon but both of these JBL products have it and are deserving, in my opinion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good deal,5,Good deal
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Short battery life,4,"These do not have 12 hours of play time. At four hours of use, it's down to one bar, and thats flashing. Sound quality is excellent, it just doesn't last all day at work."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,Play music with iPhone. Loves the sound of music!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Reliable, great sound for the size, and durable",5,"I couldn't ask for a better speaker for the size. Great quality, just enough bass for small spaces, but also loud enough to listen to in a large room without having to enclose in a structure to reverb the sound outward. Unless you just want a few extra dB. You can't lose."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Performs as promised,5,FOr my grandson created joy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",not sure it was a gift,5,a gift
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, easy to set up",4,"Overall the speaker is great, lightweight, and very easy to set up. Was able to test the party feature and it worked great. Would recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably priced portable speaker that gives good sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This lil speaker GOES HARD!,5,"I use it everyday. Had it for about 2 years now. Durable, great battery life, sound quality and amplification (volume)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",El mejor altavoz en el mercado!!!,5,"Esta reseña es de la experiencia que he tenido usando el JBL flip4 durante 5 meses.Al inicio no sabia si comprar el JBL flip4 o flip5. Viendo algunos videos y reviews opte a comprarme el flip4 por ciertos puntos.Pros:1. La calidad de construcción del altavoz y del empaquetado.2. La diferencia de calidad del sonido entre ambos es mínima los dos son geniales.3. Tiene opción de cable auxiliar.4. Buena conexión de Bluetooth, nunca me ha fallado.5. Tiene sonido estéreo, mientras que el flip 5 no lo tiene.6. Tiene gran variedad de colores para elegir el que más le guste.7. Tiene micrófono por lo que se puede responder a llamadas y usar los asistentes de su celular.8. Buena duración de la batería y carga rápido.9. Es muy fácil de llevar a cualquier lado.Cons:1. Es un altavoz que no es nuevo, claro actualmente está el flip 5, sin embargo la diferencia es mínima.2. El cargador de entrada es el micro usb, a diferencia que el flip5 que es tipo C me parece que hoy en día en 2021 el cable que más se utiliza es el tipo C.Conclusión:Es una de las mejores compras que he realizado por Amazon. Lo conecto con mi celular para escuchar música y en mi compu para ver peliculas/series. Lo recomiendo al 100%."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Still working years later,5,Yep
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding.,5,It works and sounds as good as I anticipated.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love JBLs,5,"The sound is perfect but the battery life goes kind of fast, so if you're looking for something that lasts longer, go for the JBL charge. I've had zero issues with connection to bluetooth and we even run 2 at the same time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",UPS SUCKS!!!,4,"First of all this speaker could be a defective one. Charging was bad, it was disconnecting frequently and turning off as if it was not charged which sometimes I had to used it while it was plugged, but minutes after I unplugged it turned off as if it was dead. Although it was connected to my phone, my daughter’s phone interrupted my music, sometimes she was watching stuff on her phone and I couldn’t listen to my music nor she was able to listen to her videos because the sound was stopped for both of us. When she put play my music stopped and when I put play her video stopped. It was just weird! I requested a replacement and I was ready to  The BIG ISSUE is UPS, my daughter told me that my speaker was gonna arrived yesterday, which I was expecting it 5/27/20 and I checked on Amazon and it said that it was delivered at 4:01 pm when I checked it was 4:08 pm, so it was nothing in front of my house (I live in the back on an alley and my address instructions is not to give my stuff to the neighbors because they steal them) so obviously I thought they delivered it to the neighbors.... awkward moment the following day (today) my brother checked the mailbox and it was in it?! So first they lied it was delivered yesterday and I had already started my refund and my comment about how mad I was that most likely my neighbors will be enjoying my speaker and now I had to return the defective speaker and in the end I will have no speaker.. seriously I was already looking to buy the same speaker somewhere else, because I thought UPS gave my stuff to my neighbors. Well, good thing I got the replacement before I bought a new one!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",exelent,5,a really good deal
"JBL Flip 4, Black",quality sound,4,very good product but had a hard time getting it to sync with my phone
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker is great. I needed a 2 speaker setup for work ...,5,"This speaker is great. I needed a 2 speaker setup for work and home use, where one would sit on my toolbox while a second would travel around in a service cart with me. I had considered MiniRig due to hifi sound quality, size, unlimited daisy chaining, great app options and dedicated subwoofer but ultimately the lack of play/pause/volume buttons on the speakers as well as price drove me away. I decided to try one of these, and just ordered a second now that I have checked sound quality. JBL told me if the speakers time out when connected (if you have media not playing for example), they will lose their link and you will have to reconnect them. I had trouble finding that information and had to call, so hopefully it helps someone else. JBL said they would implement this feature in the future where they would relink on power up, this would open up options of having full room wireless setups semi-permanently arranged, would not have to pick them all up and connect every time. I will chime back in here with comments once I've thoroughly tested using 2 of them at once, in and outside of work.Pros:-Can play and charge at the same time - unlimited runtime for parties if plugged into the wall. Should be loud enough to cover at least one room, but will be running at upper volume levels-Bluetooth 4.2 and Connect+, exclamation point logo indicating latest design language from JBL-Exterior is rugged, waterproof and has a wrist strap - no need for additional carrying bags or enclosures unless you want to preserve aesthetics-Much louder, more bass and better quality than the Clip 2Cons:-The 40mm drivers and passive radiators just don't make bass. That's okay, it's an unwinnable battle of physics in a speaker this small. They do kick enough to leave you with the impression that this little speaker has attitude. Adding an Xtreme 2 or boombox into the daisy chain would surely help with that-I can't think of any other cons. The sound quality is not particularly super high end or anything, but it does sound more than acceptable. It really is a fantastic looking speaker in person, particularly the passive radiators. The buttons are very nice and easy to press, unlike the Clip 2's recessed clickless buttons."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker for a decent price.,4,"I've got three of these. They can all be connected together to give a surround sound experience and they work best indoors, but actually carry well outdoors as well. A drawback to connecting the devices is range. Unfortunately, the range on these isn't really that great. So, for outdoor uses, it can be annoying when one speaker moves too far away and you have to reconnect manually if it's separated for too long. Indoors, you have to worry about walls and things that mess with signal strength. Even a single, hollow, basic door can interrupt the signal if you move more than 10 feet away from the signal transmitter.I particularly love the water resistance on these bad boys because I take mine kayaking all the time. I have, in fact, tested the submersibility of these and, although not recommended, they will not be harmed if only underwater for a few seconds. So, definitely don't worry if it starts raining, but it's still best to give them a little refuge from the constant barrage of water. Spalshing is fine, even mud is OK (again, not recommended...but it won;t break the thing) and you can wash it off if it gets dirty...Just don't go overboard- it's still a speaker.It's biggest drawback is the battery life. The louder it gets and the more bass you push, the shorter the battery life. I have had one of these for 2 years and it's still lasts for a good 6 hours on one full charge with continuous play at max volume.very easy to use and set-up.Overall, a fantastic speaker at a really decent price- the surround sound feature is an excellent selling point- although, I wish it was compatible with other JBL surround devices...stupid software changes (but that's a whole other issue)...Get it. It's worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Loud and clear audio, easy connectivity, solid build.",5,"I bought two of these a few yars ago and they are still going strong. There are whoofer speakers at each end for low bass output, and the main speakers are great. The sound is clear and fully covers bass to treble. This product will fill an 20x30 foot room with sound that can be cranked up to such loud sound people will be asking you to turn it down. Ran over 6 hours straight at a graduation party outside with excellent results. The units can be set up as a stereo pair. (Get one red the other white or black for easy setup). Very satisfied with this purchase. There is now a slightly bigger unit for just $10 more per unit, with an even bigger battery.Another nice feature is that you can BlueTooth pair or connect by an aux output from your computer, then you can extend the pairing to as many other of these units by pressing a second button that sets up pairing with as may JBL speakers as you want to spread around the house. That is in addition to the stereo setup that can done with an app that is loaded on your iPad or iPhone.This is a solid unit. The inputs are fully gasketed. Rubber bumpers at the ends. solid buttons that are waterproof. Great for the beach, great for travel. I haven't tried dropping, but I wouldn't worry if I did.The Flip 4 is great! But the Flip 5 should be even better! Higher output, bigger battery. Maybe even better bass since it is a little bigger."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Bluetooth Speaker for the Buck !,5,"My 2nd JBL Flip 4 - my original one flew all over the world with me for over 5 years and withstood multiple scratches, drops, spills - you name it, I put my first one thru hell and it delivered . My new one arrived yesterday and charged it and was playing within an hour of opening the box. If you read reviews of the Flip 5, Flip 6 and above, you'll note that the larger JBL Flip speakers only get ""Boomier"" with increased size. I prefer the clarity of my Flip 4 and the new models offer features that the older ones did not - less than $100 bucks and it JAMS!!! love my JBL Flip 4 and highly recommend it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",VERY NICE!,4,Wanted a decent speaker for my work shop to listen to some tunes while I worked.  Blown away at the quality sound and power from such a small package.  It fills my 10x20 area with good sound and decent bass.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","You can do better, but it will cost you a LOT more.",5,"Things I like:1. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and works every time.2. Sound quality is very good, very balanced with no over-emphasis on any area. If you are an audiophile, you know what I mean when I say it has a VERY flat response (a good thing).3. Bass gets surprisingly low if you know how to use a 5 band equalizer, but only sounds good that way with lower volumes..to be expected.4. Price is right on the money for value. It's what you would expect to pay for what you get.5. Fully waterproof and submersible.6. Mini USB is good for me as all my other devices still use it. Lack of USB-C not a negative for me.7. Love the 5 dot battery meter so I never run out of juice suddenly.8. Aux input is handy but I don't use it myself.9. Everything about this speaker feels rugged, hefty, reliable, user friendly, and stowable for travel.Things I don't like:1. My only complaint is that while it DOES have 2 drivers for true stereo sound, the stereo image is verynarrow and focused, making you put the speaker directly in front of you to truly appreciate the good audio. There is no ""spatial"" effect to be found here, but it's a small price to pay for all the positives. Its a great speaker to play when I have company at the dinner table."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works so well!,5,This speaker works so well! The sound is great though the battery life is only okay but it’s not bad. Just loses battery a little bit faster than I thought it would.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",a little emphasis on vocals,4,"Been using it for about a month now and have had no problems with.  Here's my 2-cents worth review:It does get very loud for such a small speaker. I was really impressed with the amount of volume and punch coming out of this little thing.  It had no problems filling a med sized room with about 10-12 people. The battery life is amazing!  We kept it playing all night for a party and never had to charge it (the iPhone 6 battery crapped out well before the speaker's did).  The construction is solid and well engineered to take some abuse.  The option to Bluetooth chain several of these speakers together and configure two on them in left-right stereo mode is also a huge plus.With that aside, the main thing I hate about it is that there is some kind of processing going on where when you turn up the volume it creates a bump in the midrange frequencies that colors the sound a bit and places an exaggerated emphasis on vocals which I don't care for.  It's almost like a slight ""center channel"" effect.  If you like to hear very clear vocal tracks or dialog then this is the speaker for you.  There should be a switch to turn this processing off (music mode / video dialog mode) - or at least include this feature in the free ""JBL connect"" iphone app so you can control the speaker's sound EQ (music, video, dialog, podcast, etc).  My Yamaha soundbar has it, why can't the Flip 4 have it too.  The speaker's sound quality is decent as long as you are playing certain types of music through it.  I found it sounds a bit harsh and chopped when playing traditional jazz, classical, or world music through it at higher volumes - (the sound of a jazz drum kit, upright string bass, and a sax together sounded horrible at higher volumes).  At lower volumes it sounds more flat and natural. The speaker seems to be more suited for playing rock, dance music, R&B, pop, country, and video/DVD soundtracks.  Placing the speaker against a wall or flat object is definitely recommended and will help to bring out more bass and round out the sound a bit.As comparing it with a few other speakers I have tested the Flip 4 is definitely one of the best (and loudest) in it's price range.  I would give it 3.5 stars but I have to round it up to 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,Can hear throughout my small house with good sound quality.  Just wish it had an auto shut off feature to help with battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for a small speaker,5,Great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The BEST Speaker,5,Me and my brother each have one and it makes get togethers so fun! We just link them up and automatically turn things into a party! The sound is AMAZING and the size make it perfect for outdoor days at the beach or at the park. I even bought one for my dad because I love it so much!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Altavoz JBL,5,"Es el tercer altavoz que he comprado el mejor, lo recomiendo…Para esta época de navidad que buen regalo…"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It's survived me, so it's basically indestructible.",5,"This thing comes with me everywhere I go. It rides in the water bottle side-holder on my backpack that gets slung around everywhere. It goes to work with me and rides on my forklift getting tossed around and dropped off on hard concrete. It goes in the shower with me, doesn't mind getting water and shampoo all over it. It comes to parties where beer gets spilled all over it and drunk people accidentally kick it across the room. All this, and not even a scratch.The sound is ridiculously good for coming out of something so small. The bass is perfect, and the max volume can raddle your skull. It'll last 10 hours straight on medium volume, and is quick to charge (from dead to full in about 30mins). It's such a simple device yet adds so much to my everyday life. It was right at $90 when I bought it and it's definitely worth every penny, especially compared to other portable BT speakers out there.I've had the JBL Flip 4 for four months now, and have had no problems thus far. Which is amazing because I abuse it on a daily basis. This thing's a real trooper and I'll update if any quality changes occur.03/11/2023 - UPDATEIt was so good someone finally stole ot at work.I want it back."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery on this speaker lasts really long!,5,The sound quality and battery life are on a level of their own!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Didn’t have that big sound and bass I was looking for,5,Could’ve been more bolder
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Todo bien,4,Todo bien
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Returned an Oontz to buy this instead -- was the right decision,5,"I initially tried to save some money and bought an Oontz (forget which model, it was about half the price, though, so this might not be comparing apples to apples) triangle-shaped speaker. It arrived, and honestly it sounded so horrible I assumed it must be defective and returned it.  I'm not really a sound snob, but that speaker sounded awful. Everything was distorted and mushy, even at medium volumes.So, after reading that basically everybody thought the JBL speakers sounded better, I decided to order this one. So far, I'm super happy.  What sounded distorted and mushy on the Oontz sounds clear and warm on the JBL, even at louder volumes. The JBL does sound the tiniest bit tinny or hollow, but that is just me being critical, it doesn't bother me at all.  Honestly I was surprised at how good the speaker sounded.As for volume, we had an older, cheaper Barricade speaker that we took to the tennis court, but unless we were right near the speaker, we couldn't enjoy the music (i.e. when we were both at opposite baselines of the court, neither of us could hear the music clearly).  With this speaker, even at half volume, the music is nice and clear on the court. I take it into the garage when I'm ""working"" on ""projects"" and it's more than beefy enough to fill the space even at lower volumes. We have ~600 sq foot living / dining room and I think 1 of these would be enough to comfortably listen in that space.Battery charge -- I haven't had this very long, but I've listened to it for about 8 hours so far and haven't yet needed to recharge. Can't really comment on that, other than I'm happy if I need to throw this on the charger once a week or so, which seems to be the case."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente sonido y diseño,5,Súper buena
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm a fan.,5,"I went and compared 3 similar portable speakers with each other (same price of around $100 each):JBL Flip 4- Best quality sound of the 3 (amazing quality - very similar to Bose Soundlink Mini)- No noticeable crackle at max volume with high treble in music- Strongest/deepest bass (my table was shaking on max volume)- Very loud max volumeUltimate Ears WONDERBOOM- Smaller than JBL 4 but larger than Bose Micro- Crackling at max volume for some songs with high treble (Was not expecting this)- Bass is not as strong (very slight bass)- Very loud max volume (similar to JBL 4)Bose SoundLink Micro Bluetooth- Smallest of the 3- Max sound was at 75% that of JBL 4/Ultimate Ears- Sounds ""muffled"" and not clear (quality is not even close to that of Bose Soundlink Mini)- Exposed charging slot (is this really waterproof?)Overall - I would pick JBL (amazing quality & very similar to Bose Soundlink Mini, but waterproof!) and Ultimate Ears for portability (75 % size of JBL 4). The Bose Micro, although very small, had really poor quality sound for the price (most disappointing)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fav Speaker,5,I bought this product to have in my dorm room and I love it. Sound quality is great and you do not have to charge it often at all. This was also my repurchase because I lost my first. That shows how much I love this speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Appears to be a great product, but just started using it yesterday, since it was a gift.",5,"It is too early to give an educated evaluation. So far, I love the great sound and connectivity was not anything issue."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Best purchase yet, Amazing quality and sound!",5,"We were loyal and very dedicated to the Bose speakers club, and still love most of our Bose products.  But based on the great reviews, and out of curiosity for the price point compared to Bose and added features these speakers have we decided to give JBL a try.  Omg! Instantly fell in love and our expectations were completely blown out of the water.  Super easy to use, and all the amazing features we were looking for.  The sound quality, and overall quality of these speakers (we purchased a few) completely exceeded our expectations.  These were by far the best purchase we’ve made in a long time. And don’t even get me started on the price for the value of what you’re getting.  Hands down we are completely converted to JBL and couldn’t be happier.  Perfect for so many reason super convenient for people on the go, the functionality and super easy to use with a top of the line quality product and amazing sound without breaking the bank.  We will be adding one or two more to complete our “collection” and totally can guilt free, since they are so affordable but hands down one of our best purchases yet!  If your on the fence give them a try, You won’t regret it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Gotta spent to get quality sound,5,"The concept of bluetooth speaker is usually small cheap with low quality sound.  As technologies advances premium speakers now comes with solid construction, large drivers and high power amplifiers.  For those who is in the market for a cheap speaker will find hundreds to choose from.  No matter how good the reviews are for the Tribet, Oontz and UE Booms they are all run of the mill speakers that only satisfies the masses.  For high quality sound buyers usually have to step up to a higher price point.  While higher end Bose, Sony and Harmon costs over $200, half of that will get you pretty decent sounding speakers.  The Flip 4 looks great and its easy to carry, rugged and waterproof.  With 10 hours of battery life this little speaker can pump out clear highs and satisfying lows.  Voice sound natural and bass drum comes with a kick.  There are numerous placement options for the speaker and all controls are intuitive and easy to reach.  The clean upper range produced is a good sign that the component speakers are of good quality.  Driving 8 watts X 2 along with 2 side firing bass radiators the speaker has enough power to fill a medium sized room.  Like most I have been in the market for a good sounding speaker and have been disappointed time after time.  Realizing that a cheaper speaker will simply not satisfy my needs, going up in pricing to get the Flip 4 was the best decision I made.  If sound quality, portability and all-weather construction is important to you then you should spend to get this.  At $90, this little gem is better than the Bose, Harmon and Sony counterparts."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",NICE,5,Love how loud this little guy gets.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","No better than Oontz angle, but...",3,"Assuming this is a legit Flip 4, side by side to Oontz angle. What is better is the default frequency with flat EQ the Flip 4 sounds good, the oontz sounds bright no bass. But if you want to save money and don't mind dialing in the oontz they are equal in volume, bass, and actually the Oontz has a little better high frequencies. I would have expected the JBL to blow the Oontz away on bass, but no. So for plug in play the Flip 4 wins."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",After 2 months,3,"They don’t hold a charge like they did at first.$35 a year for a subscription to an app that makes them run ??One of them vibrates because it’s already blown. .., I’m using them in my house a little.You’re probably better off getting the more expensive JBL extreme"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great loud sounds,5,"The only complaint is that it must be stood up and not laid flat, so it rolls a bit. It should have a flat bottom so you could put in both positions."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound for those who like to Rock!,5,"I bought the JBL Flip 4 a year ago and I couldn't be happier with its performance!  After years of buying Jam Touch speakers and having them quit after a few months, I just moved on.  I like all types of music, but I'm a die hard classic rock fan.  I want good bass quality and no tinny sounds at all; that's too much treble folks. This speaker delivers exactly what I want and it seems to go for days on end without a charge.  Although I don't often play it at full volume, when I do there isn't a single rattle, reverb, or crackling issue to be heard.  I even had the neighbor complain the other day that it was too loud!  This coming from a 19 year old who plays music from speakers in his back yard all hours of the night!The pairing experience with this speaker is seamless.  It pairs instantly with my Samsung Note 20 Ultra, android tablet, and laptop.Today I'm ordering a second JBL Flip 4 to pair up with mine to kick up the stereo experience.  Keep in mind you can't pain the Flip 4 with the JBL Flip 5 due to the Flip 5's PartyBoost limitations!All in all this is a great little speaker for the money!  It's portable, stylish, and has a sound that can't be beat at this price!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",As expected.,5,"JBL sounds good as the "" B"" guys."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Started out strong,3,"I was obsessed with this speaker the second I got it. Sadly about a year or so in the battery life started declining. Now after a year and a half its useless. It started shutting off, even when on the charger. Then it started crackling and making loud distorted noises. Now it won't turn on at all. Considering how expensive it was I'm pretty disappointed"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buen sonido,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Tiene buen sonido."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, but don't pair with desktop",4,"Great sound, mike also works well. Deducting 1 star because you need the JBL connect app to work properly and I wanted to connect this speaker to my laptop for zoom calls. Can't do that in Windows and the emulators don't work. So speaker can only be used with mobile phones."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Holy Crap...What a difference,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I don't have a cool and long comparison review to give you. All I can say is that I upgraded from my EXOGEAR that I've had for...too long. The connection is quick and the sound is beautiful. So happy. Thanks!Jake during the pic and then...after the pic...Disclaimer: No animals or speakers were harmed during this review."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Happy with Speaker. Great customer service from both amazon and JBL!,5,"The JBL4 flip speaker i purchased a few weeks ago worked great with my Moto G7 phone. The bluetooth connected automatically when both were turned on to bluetooth. I purchased this for a dance exercise class at the beach. We all loved the sound and was able to hear the music and words clearly. However, it would not pair with my iphone7.Then, because I could not connect this speaker with my iphone7 I hit the ""forget this device"" link on the Moto G7 thinking this would help. It still did not connect to the iphone7 . iphone7 never located the speaker.Well, now I went back to the Moto G7 and it no longer would connect to the JBL4 flip speaker either.Then amazon customer service connected me directly with a JBL tech support when I called about my problem. JBL helped my Moto G7 reconnect with the JBL4 flip speaker with a few resets. But no luck with the iphone7. They stated that they have not been able to get the iphone7 specifically to connect and had been trying for a while. We got off the phone and I kept looking for the magic button and I found it. Privacy->Location Services->System Settings--> Network and Wireless and turn it on! Then I hit the bluetooth button to locate devices and the JBL4 was found by my iphone7!! So this was not the JBL speakers fault! It was how to make your iphone7 findable by the bluetooth device. YAY."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Happy,5,"It's my first wireless speaker so can't compare it to anything, but as it was an older model (Flip 4) and cheaper that the new models I got it and have been quite happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best one out here,3,Works very well supper loud had it for about 2 years now kicking nice and strong
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't try to use it with non-native Bluetooth TV,4,"The sound quality was very good, in the limited testing I did.  My goal was to use these (I bought two) as additional speakers for my TV, or to use them instead of the TV's built-in speakers.  The TV is not natively Bluetooth-capable, so I bought a third-party Bluetooth transmitter (1Mii B03Lite), connected to my TV via optical (TOSLink) cable. I also wanted one speaker to provide LEFT channel only and the other speaker RIGHT channel only, for true stereo, rather than having each speaker provide both left AND right channels.  These speakers ARE able to do this, but only through use of the JBL Connect app on your phone or tablet.  I was concerned that the left/right separation would work ONLY while the phone was connected, which it normally wouldn't be in my scenario.  However, once turned on in the app, the left/right separation continued to work, even when the phone was off and the sound source was the Bluetooth transmitter connected to the TV.  The big problem -- and this might very well have been the fault of the transmitter, not the speakers -- was that there was a 1-2 second delay in the sound coming from the TV, so that the sound did not match up with lip movement.  That made the TV essentially unwatchable.  Because of this problem, I will need to return the speakers and the Bluetooth transmitter.  I will cross-post this review to the BT transmitter, as well, so that people know that it's the COMBINATION of the two that doesn't work as hoped.  The speakers themselves seem to work well, albeit in limited testing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wireless pairing is fantastic. Highly recommend these speakers,5,"I bought four of these for a party I was hosting where we didn't have access to the built in speakers. I had a couple options, I have other bluetooth speakers, but I would only be able to connect one to my phone and play from one end of the room. The other option was bringing my bookshelf stereo system from 2004 to the party and spread the speakers out as far as the wires would allow but again it would only be on one side of the room so I would have had to blast both options in order for the other side of the room to hear it, thus making the people closer to the speakers hate me. SOO I found these and ordered four to try out in my situation. I connected one to my phone then the other three to the source speaker. I was able to put one speaker in each corner of the room and flawlessly stream spotify from my phone and have a nice volume level throughout the hall. I had numerous people ask me how I was playing music all over and I introduced them to the speakers. In fact my step father liked them so much he bought two of them from me (I had no need for four after that day anyway so it worked out for me) I have used the remaining two speakers numerous times since I bought them, most recently at the beach on my family vacation. I was able to leave my phone in the truck, stream music to both speakers and provide music amongst 5 pop up tents, the only struggle was finding the kind of music everyone enjoyed! :P"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker!,5,My ex and I had a black one but we split up so I had to get one too!! Best speaker to me!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Drown out the haters,5,So I work in a sandwich place and the customers hate me but now with this speaker I don't have to deal with their BS. Also my management is also annoying and complain about how loud the speaker gets so if you're looking for loud then look no further.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker You Will Find At $100,5,"Before anyone assumes that I received any sort of discount, I bought this at the full price of $99.95Price - As the title indicates, in my opinion this truly is the best speaker out there that you can buy with $100. At $99.95 this speaker is very affordable, of course if you live in most states you will pay about $7 more for tax but in certain states you won't be charged any. In the box you will receive a JBL Flip 4 speaker (with a paracord loop), a JBL tangle free Micro-USB cable, Quick Start Guide, Important Safety Instructions, and a Warranty Card.Build - The JBL Flip 4 is considered a rugged speaker and also because it is IPX7 waterproof, it can be immersed in water up to 1 meters (or roughly 3 feet) for up to half an hour. Just remember to disconnect all cables and close the rubber flap. Although this is a rugged speaker, I would try very hard not to drop this or physically damage it. The Flip 4 has a total of 6 buttons: Play/Pause/Skip Track/Google or Siri/Answer/End Call, Volume Up, Volume Down, Bluetooth, Power, and JBL Connect+ (Connect+ allows you to connect 100 or more Connect+ enabled speakers for a surround sound experience or to full bigger areas). The Flip 4 also has 2 ports and an opening for your paracord loop, the 2 ports under the rubber flap are for a 3.5mm AUX cable and a Micro-USB charging cable. There is also a built-in microphone for calls or voice commands using Google or Siri.Sound - I have few things to say about the sound quality of this speaker, simply because it is that amazing! The Flip 4 is unlike most speakers $100 and under. This speaker will not lose sound quality at max volume nor will it get distorted with bass heavy tracks. Even when under water, the sound will not suffer, it actually seems to increase your bass.I highly recommend this product and encourage anyone looking for a speaker around $100 to purchase the JBL Flip 4"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good travel speaker,4,"Not as loud as I expected from JBL, but still a good speaker. Use it all the time at the beach and on the river."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect!,5,Very good sound for small speaker! Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lasted me two years,4,"After two years of regular use, the miniusb charger port broke. This is just outside the product support window of Amazon, and JBL itself only offered a one/year warranty. If you’re investing in this speaker, you need to get a 3-year coverage plan."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Premium feeling & sounding speaker for a budget price!,5,"(tldr at the bottom)Before I purchased this speaker I was using a UE Boom, most likely a first generation model. It was nice, and did what I needed it to. But it was getting old and the battery life was non-existent. So! I hopped on Amazon and found this speaker on sale, and I thought why not. When it came in I was very surprised at the overall quality. I've also had a Nose Mini SoundLink Gen 1, and I compare almost all portable speakers to that. This doesn't quite come close to the Bose, but that's okay! This isn't in the same category. For the price, you get an awesome, little speaker that kicks some nice bass (the sides move like a subwoofer!), it has a solid weight to it for a small speaker so it feels premium (which is important for some people), and the connection to your phone along with controlling the speaker is seamless. It has a little rope for attaching it to something, and a rubber cover for the charging port. I haven't tested the water resistance/proofness of the speaker, but it's fine so far after being in the bathroom when I shower!TLDR:If you're looking for a ""budget"" speaker that eminates a build quality similar to premium brands, and that produces quality sound comparable to the same brands, buy this speaker.Catch it on sale if you can for an extra boost, but if you're worried about this disappointing you at all... don't!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best little Speaker,5,"I’ve had it for 3 months now.  Used it around the house, garage, and took it to the beach for 7 days. Its so worth it.  Sound, durability, battery life, connects to your phone easily,  I don’t know what else to say. What, $80, $90, if it lasts  3 years it’s worth every penny. The sound is really good, good bass, volume is good.  If you need a speaker, buy it. You want regret it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome ass speaker,5,This product is well worth the money spent
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase,5,"My dad is not savvy when it comes to technology. Got him this speaker... he not only knows how to operate it, but he's learned how to use his iPhone. Well, he can get to his music. He listens to this speaker every day, it has great sound and the wireless feature allows him to sit on the porch or backyard."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive little guy!,5,"Previously I loved my Bose Bluetooth SoundLink II but it barely got drizzled on outside and thereafter wouldn’t turn on; so this time I bought a waterproof one! I assumed it wouldn’t have the best sound compared to Bose name brand but I was wrong… it’s BETTER! I also appreciate the little carrying case to keep it clean, and the Bluetooth connection is almost instant!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 Musing - My New #1,5,"Although I'm not doing speaker reviews anymore I was so impressed by the JBL Flip 4 that I had to write a little something. The Xiaomi Mi has been my go-to BT speaker. It has really great sound; especially for the size. Sadly I accidentally played some frequency test tones at high volume and my Xiaomi Mi was blown. After 3 days of only having laptop speakers I was fed up. I needed something better. Good things have been written about the JBL Flip 3, and I always wanted to give it a try. Now the 4 is out and I hear it's even better! Being desperate for quality sound I bought one.I really wasn't planning on buying any speakers and really couldn't afford it. I'm experienced and very picky about audio. From all I've read my expectations were very high. Given all of this the odds were stacked high against the Flip 4.Once I heard the thing I was stunned at how full and well balanced it sounds! I have a thing for small speakers that sound big and this doesn't disappoint at all. Even better is that it manages to sound big without any lame DSP tainting the sound. There is no silly bass boost and no compression; just good full sound. This is my new #1."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sounds!,5,Great Sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The BEST speaker in it's price range.,5,"This small buddy is doing all you would expect it to do and more. Seriously, great sound from such a small speaker.It can satisfy almost all your need (will write about it later)You need it for a small / medium house. Great, this is what you need. Despite the size, it can be really loud, and the best thing is that it still sound great at max vol, you can hear quality bass and everything.If you like to listen to music outside, take a speaker everywhere with you, you'll like it too. For all biking lovers - it perfectly fits in the bottle holder.And ever when it'll start to rain - hide the speaker from getting wet will be the last think you need to think about,  Flip 4 is COMPLETELY waterproof.If you like to listen to music in a shower (like I do), you'll like it too, you even can answer phones while in a shower ( well, that'll be a little weird).Another cool feature  - you can connect 2 devices to it at the same time. Do you have a friend that always wants to play HIS track on YOUR speaker? Now you both can stay connected and if you don't like the track you can stop it and play your's again (not a nice thing to do, but hey, but sometimes it's really helpful).You even can connect up to 100 devices to play at the same time, don't know who will do this, but I would like to see this.The only downside is that it doesn't float in the water ( if you like to listen to music underwater maybe you'll be ok with it). But if you'll accidentally drop it into water it may be hard to find it after.Bottom line -  great speaker for the money. I'm happy bought it.(*sorry for my grammar, if something. I'm not a native speaker)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not quite up to expectations for JBL.,4,"I like JBL stuff. Really. But I gave this four out of five stars for a few reasons. First of all, I'm fully aware that this is a small speaker. Most of the reviews say that this flip4 is super. I think its merely good for what it is. Overall sound quality is good, but due to the small size, there's not alot of bass. Nice weight and feel to the speaker and the materials are top notch.  The sound doesnt really distort at full volume, but theres not much difference between about 70% to 100%. A little bonus is the lanyard attached to it. I added a carabiner clip so I can carry it anywhere. The waterproof design is great and the speaker feels very durable. However, when laid flat it tends to roll. JBL should have made the ends hexagonal so that it's immobile on flat surfaces. Nice to be able to listen to other media and take calls if needed on the phone. Also, the battery life sucks. I dont get more than 4 hours of playback before having to recharge. I've never tried to connect multiple speakers using the JBL connect feature, but maybe that's what makes these popular. I bought this during black Friday, so I got a decent deal, but I would not pay full price.Update 2/14/19My Flip4 fell on the floor at work today because the cheap little plastic piece that holds the paracord broke off. What a cheap piece of garbage. They could have made it out of metal molded into the rubber casing, but they took the easy way out . For something that's supposed to secure your speaker, JBL dropped the ball (and my speaker).Like I said initially...I'm glad I didn't pay full retail. Come on, JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bought this as a present,5,I bought this as a present for my mother's birthday. Works better than the portable speaker I have. High quality sound. Fantastic price point. Now to get one for myself. Lol.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great for its price, battery dies fast.",3,"Battery dies really fast and you can't have the volume very high.I had a lot of trouble connecting via Bluetooth but then I got the hang of it. There's a separate botton for the JBL connect app which is just extra. Why would I download another app if I can use other methods to connect?Ion the other hand, i am being too critical because the overal quality is really good, especially for this price. I need it for a big conference room so should have bought either a pair or a stronger one. Love JBL products!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good equipment,4,very satisfied with this product......
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for indoor use.,3,"I had high expectations for this one (base on reviews) but it's not what I expected. The sound is clear and the connection is good, however, it is not very strong in volume. It's great for indoor but I would have to find a better one for outdoor since I have a big yard."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",supports a wide range of music,5,"Let me be clear from the beginning that this is not a long-term review. I bought this product yesterday. That being said, I have just ordered another one to connect with it. That's how impressed with it I am.I had been using a big Geneva tabletop unit with wonderful sound for years, but it had an unfortunate accident. I bought an Oontz angle 3 to fill in while I made up my mind about what to do next. (It quickly became clear that the Oontz angle 3 is not something I'm going to use for music, though it's's fine for use with my tablet for streaming television. It is very reliable, its bluetooth connectivity is great, but the sound is flat and thin. The Flip 4, on the other hand, has a much richer and fuller sound.  Does it have the sound of my old Geneva unit? Probably not, but I can connect two of these! I can hang it out on the front porch or from a light fixture in the hall by its handy strap. It has connected easily to both devices that I have tried it with so far. I play a wide range of music, from metal to solo vocal, from Indian classical to ambient electronic. The sound is good across ranges.It's clear from reviews of all devices that there are some lemons out there, so I'm hoping I got hold of a good unit and I'm happy to have Amazon behind me and my purchase.  If I have troubles, I'll update."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love my Flip 4!!!,5,"Ordered May of 20 & waited to review after it's been through some significant wear. Had many BT speakers and they've all taken a crap from a tumble or light water spray, even being rated rugged/water resistant.My opinion: won't get a better speaker for the money you pay! Been dropped many times, been down the river on a tubing trip (submerged multiple times), camping trips, & used almost daily.  Takes a lickin & keeps on tickin! Recharges at a decent rate (charged via wall at home, car, & solar battery pack while camping), plays for hours without losing sound integrity after battery is low, great sound/bass. Multiple speaker hookup (daisy chain) via BT which is awesome as a few friends also purchased these and we hook them up at outings and spread them out for an almost concert-like effect. Convenient to carry in purse, pack or duffle. Hand strap is a nice bonus as you can hang it just about anywhere. I plan on buying more of these. Would HIGHLY recommend - badass little speaker!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",OMG THE BEST PURCHASE !,5,I love these speakers ! They are super loud and convenient. I usually take it on vacation or whenever I hangout in my yard. No issues and it charges very fast. 100% would recommend!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A bit tinny but better than phone speaker,5,"Would be nice if app had an equalizer, but I do enjoy being able to listen outside while gardening. Recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I LOVE MY FLIP4,5,"This is my 2nd JBL Flip4.  I love the ease of connectivity and that it has a microphone built in.  I can listen to music in the shower, take calls when I'm getting ready, use my Siri Voice Controls and everything.  The sound quality of this JBL is so good and full.  My taste in music is very broad and the fullness of sound that comes from this little speaker is unmatched in my life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get your own!,5,"Freaking love this thing and take it everywhere. I'm a musician, so I really appreciate the well balanced and detailed sound for what this is. Portability is great, calls actually work well on it, battery lasts an entire day by the pool (can confirm waterproof status as far as it won't kill it, but don't expect it to sound good in water). It also feels really, really solid. Like you could definitely knock someone out with it.It's bassy enough for me, I've got a JL ported 8"" box in my truck if that tells you anything... I like balanced sound, not overpowering bass. I read entirely too many reviews of Bluetooth speakers in the range, and compared it to the UE Boom in best buy. Sound is somewhat subjective, but I found the UE sound to be a little thin in the midrange but had slightly more dynamic imaging in a room, but if you're using it outside I'm not sure that will show. The Flip 4 sounds fuller, warmer, while a bit more direct.If you understand that Beats headphones are garbage, you'll probably like this speaker. It's not a sub in the trunk, but you'll hear all the bass notes, though you won't necessarily feel them. It's an impressive product by JBL. I honestly wasn't a big JBL fan before this. Always thought their sound was Bose-ish...As in overrated and underwhelming. But it's very balanced, clear, and impressively powerful for its size.Sometimes I'll put this in the exterior bike-helmet pocket of my Camelbak M.U.L.E that has mesh openings to let sound through, and go for trail runs or long walks with my dog with tunes playing. Nice to be more aware of my surroundings (vs headphones) and that walkers can hear me coming or that cyclists approaching me can have a fair warning.If you're active like me, get it. And get your own, tired of everyone asking me to borrow it..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The de facto bt speaker.,5,This is my daily driver. I take it with me everywhere. Great product!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Quality of sound, connection with JBL Extreme",4,
"JBL Flip 4, Black",100% amazing,5,100% thrilled with this speaker.  I’ll definitely be buying  more of JBL items
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works Great,5,"This speaker works very well.  I wish there were an indicator telling what the volume setting is.  Without it, it's just trial and error.  But that's a small point."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good but not amazing,4,"it get can get loud, not distorted, but maybe muddy? My iPhone 8 speaker sounds better truer quality, even with a lifeproof case on it, the sound quality is night and day. Due to the cylinder shape the sound projection depends a lot on which way you face it and what it's surroundings are. It seems like the bass comes from one side and the higher ranges come from the other. So they do not always blend clearly. Despite other reviews the battery life is my favorite part of this device. I would recommend not over charging. They say you can leave these things plugged in beyond the full charge but we all know that's bs. It severely impairs your devices ability to hold its charge long term. I came across a deal on Amazon and I jumped on it because I always wanted one. It was $60 I think. Normally these are up over $100. I would not be pleased if I bought this for $100-150. Even $60 seems a little high to be honest. Not enough to regret it, but the bass is not as loud as advertised, and overall sound quality is lacking. The material quality on the other hand is what makes it a bargain. I have no doubt it could take a splash of water poolside. But when it comes to sound it basically sounds like a tiny portable radio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound for a small portable speaker.,5,"Good sound, small, portable, goes just about everywhere you go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Clean sounds,4,The battery life could be better but it’s ok.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,I absolutely love this speaker. Has so much power in it and I definitely wasn’t expecting it. This is my go to now. Small and portable and holds a charge that lasts more than one use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Is three years an adequate life?,3,"I was very pleased with this purchase in summer of 2019. I'm not an audiophile so I won't critique sound quality. It's good enough for me. I use this to watch YouTube videos through my phone because it's easier for my old ears to hear.I've had zero issues and have been using it almost daily for awhile. Until the past month. Now I get a crackling sound on some videos that have deep bass. Also the speaker automatically sits down at half battery life. I plug it in to recharge and the charge level starts at mid charge.It's never been dropped and has been used exclusively indoors. I do use it very often. Like I stated, it gets used almost every day and was always charged after it shut down due to low battery.You have to decide if three years of usable life is worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speakers,5,"This is a great speaker and I ordered 4 because of the ability to link up with each other with out wires (up to 4 speakers).My only ""knock"" would be that when they are paired up to each of the others, the battery power is used quite a bit. The bluetooth alone is an energy vacuum as it is.The 4 that I have, felt best by using 2 speakers at a time and charging the other two and rotating as needed. Great for a camp site/ backyard fire, a limo that didn't have a great sound system, pool side (water resistant - just dont celebrate it), getting ready time (waking up near head board, shower time to clothing to shaving),to small parties where you can stash the speakers in nooks out of the way and still have decent portable sound, barn parties up in rafters. Will not replace professional DJs and the equipment they provide.There are different size JBLs too, but i got these in the camo which I've only seen in black, red or blue at places like BestBuy, etc.You will need the nugget or a wall charger as mine only came with the USB cord. I have also made use of the lanyards as to hang them at ear level. If you place them in small rooms, just set them near the corners to get best sound resonance.Enjoy and happy listening."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doomed to fail,5,I used to swear by JBL products. My last 3 have failed me. The power button is doomed to fail no matter how little or often I use they product. I will mo longer be recommending this brand to anybody.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL has excellent sound,5,"We are very pleased with this bluetooth speaker.  Has excellent sound, volume is more than enough and is easy to use."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing and extremely handy to bring anywhere.,5,"I decided to order the Certified Refurbished for 69.00 from RARTV.  I've always ordered refurbished electronics and had good luck.  This item is absolutely perfect.  Don't let the ""plain box"" thing stray you.  It's still very clearly custom made to fit the speaker perfectly,  it has cardboard holders on each end keeping the speaker suspended in the middle.  And a JBL sticker that fit's over the top of the box, not just a sticker pasted on, it's tailored to the box.  So you if don't care about the blah blah on-boxing and packaging, you get what you need.  The speaker doesn't have a mark on it and I wouldn't believe that it's not new, just repackaged due to a return our something.  That being said, I'm a child of the 80's where we had 5' tall speakers and massive amps.  I'm constantly amazed at how far things have come.  For it's size I'm astonished how well it sounds.  If you stick it in the corner of you counter top while cooking you'll get much more bass giving it corners to bounce off.  In a complete open area, the bass is surprisingly strong, but I would say it's highlights would be vocals, and clarity of all the stuff above the deep bass.  I can say this is for, the money, this is the most satisfying electronic's purchase I've made for a long time.  As soon as I heard it I immediately started thinking of more and more places I could bring good sounding music with me.  A definite thumbs up to JBL and RARTV for giving this quality for the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not charging anymore 1.5 years-,3,It was ok sound but now it won’t charge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",it’s a really good speaker,4,i like the sound and how loud it can get but the battery life is kinda bad
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW sound for the money,5,"My previous portable speaker died after many good years of service, and decided to upgrade.  This speaker absolutely rocks in all ways - sound quality is crisp, base sounds amazing, easily connected to my iphone's bluetooth, well put together and compact unit for the incredible sound that is delivered.  I am no expert, but have a passionate amateur ear and I would buy another in a minute.  I don't usually write reviews, but I'm so happy with this unit, had to add my 2 cents."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent range and great sound!,5,"I tried many different brands before I got this one. Some were tinny, some too much bass, some just sounded like a hollow cardboard box. To my ears, the speaker is well-balanced and has a good range for such compact design. I carry it around the house and use it every day. The long range allows me to even take it to the other side of my house on a different floor. The battery life has been excellent even with the extended daily use it gets. Now I can have music on my front porch even though the source is near the back door. Recommended!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A noticeable upgrade from the Flip 3,4,"My Flip 3's battery decided to visit Valhalla recently, and after a botched attempt at repairing that old workhorse failed (I accidentally sliced through the ribbon cable, oopsie!) I had to look for a replacement unit.  After a lot of searching, reading both professional and amateur reviews of the seemingly hundreds of Bluetooth speakers out there, I decided it'd be best to just get the Flip 4.  So far, I have not been disappointed with my purchase.Compared to the previous model, it seems the sound quality has been slightly improved on this version.  It's notably brighter than before, and the bass is ever so slightly less lumpy sounding.  It still won't fill a room up with thunderous boomy bass, but none of the speakers in this size category will.  Like the previous version, this thing feels like it's built like a tank, and may survive a drop or five on a hard surface without totally breaking.  All the buttons have a nice, tactile feel to them so you can easily adjust the volume or hit the play-pause-skip button without looking.  The buttons for power and linking two devices together are more recessed now, and a bit harder to hit, but this makes it easier to carry around without accidentally turning it off mid-song.I've had the speaker now for over a week and used it for approximately 30-45 minutes each day and so far it hasn't even dropped one ""bar"" on the battery light display, so I expect battery life to at least meet the quoted time on this site, if not exceed it.So far, I'm a happy camper."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE IT,5,LOVE IT!!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL ROCKS,5,I purchased highly rated competitors' brand only to return for superior brand JBL. Won't make this mistake again for big music fan
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy buen altavoz,5,Sirve para dispositivos que no tienen Bluetooth. ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned!,5,Sound quality is amazing and what a great price!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best-sounding waterproof Bluetooth speaker < $150,5,"Testing the JBL Flip 4 against the 
UE Roll 2
 and the 
UE Boom 2
, I found that the Flip 4 delivers much cleaner and wider sound with higher quality. It's not even close! Lower bass is non-existent on the Roll 2 and Boom 2. Flip 4 delivers clean bass all the way down to 70Hz. On noisy pop/dance tracks, the Boom 2 might sound fuller on first impression, but you won't be able to make out the individual instruments. The Boom 2 in comparison sounds like it's being covered by a blanket.Comparing it against the 
JBL Charge 3
, I found that the JBL Flip 4 has much clearer treble. Also, the JBL Charge 3 is a year older and doesn't support JBL Connect+. If you're looking for something better the JBL Flip 4 across-the-board and price/size are not a concern, I recommend the 
JBL Pulse 3
, which shares all the same tech as Flip 4 but with better mids, omnidirectional sound, and LED lights.I use the Flip 4 in the shower with the bathroom fan on, and the Flip 4 never lacked volume. It's not omnidirectional, so I recommend pointing the side with the JBL wordmark (where the tweeters are located) towards you for the best sound. If you plan to use it in a bathroom, I recommend placing it vertically on a resonant surface like a counter or bathtub rim.The Flip 4 supports Siri and Google Now, but it's only provided as an option configured using the app: you decide whether the play button toggles play/pause or triggers the voice assistant. What a silly and difficult decision to have to make! I wish that the play button always toggled play/pause and press-and-hold on the button triggered the voice assistant instead."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very loud and sound great,4,"Bought 2 of these, one white and one red so that we could take advantage of stereo and party modes.  In party mode they both play the same exact audio and in stereo one is left and one right ( obviously )  I do recommend getting 2 different colors, when you open the app it actually identifies the speaker and its color so setting left or right for stereo is super simple since you can see each speaker pictured with its color.  Reason I chose these JBLs is based on some reviews I have read and watched on youtube.  They are not the loudest out there but plenty loud and for me the selling point was that even at max volume the sound was crisp and didn't distort.  They are water and dust proof, I have dropped one under water already and it still works great.  We take these along when we go paddle boarding and clip them to our boards without any worries of them getting wet.  While paddling I operate my phone all via voice which works really well with this speaker.  So as far as sound goes they are great, range is great, really are waterproof and plenty loud for a party.  Reason I took away 1 star is that there is no way to go to previous track, not that I have discovered anyway, please msg me if I am wrong and I'll up the rating. The play button acts as play/pause/and with double tap next track..  Why not add a triple tap for previous? Or maybe use the Bluetooth connect button double tap for previous?  Since the speakers get software updates maybe this is something that will get implemented.  If you are wondering if the stereo and party modes and if its worth getting these for that alone I would say yes.  We used them on a houseboat in both party and stereo mode and the sound filled the entire upper deck of the 80 ft boat with no problem."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Convenient size and links easily to other speakers,5,I use this speaker when I go paddle boarding. Being able to link to other JBL speakers is so simple and convenient. And it sounds awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound reproduction for size,5,"I had a Photive Hydra speaker I liked alot but the usb charging port collapsed.I ordered an Oontz Angle 3 based on the great reviews.When I listened to the Oontz speaker it was simply flat. Very poor bass response and the high end was very thin.I immediately sent it back and got this JBL Flip 4.The Flip 4 is exactly what I wanted in great sound reproduction. Not only is the bass response great but it images the bass very well. The high end and clarity is super good.Overall the speaker performs well, not too muddy-not too bright, accurate reproduction.Love this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely love the sound,5,I love this speaker. Great choice for the price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Crackles with low sounds,3,"My previous housemate had an old Bose Soundlink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker (II/III) that we'd frequently connect to the TV and our laptops to listen to podcasts, music, and tv shows, and occasionally use outside to watch movies on a projector. When she left, I began my search for a comparable portable bluetooth speaker since the model she has was discontinued. I thought I'd try the JBL Flip 4 because it had so many 4- and 5-star reviews and was priced under $100. The common issues described in the critical reviews seemed to be primarily due to charging problems and/or the short battery life rather than sound quality.Yesterday, when I received the speaker, I charged it completely and paired it with my TV without any issues. However, I immediately noticed a crackling sound when the speaker cut out at certain points during the dialogue portions of the crime documentary I was watching. I later tried it while watching Moana on Disney and had no sound issues at all. I could hear it clearly from all the different rooms in the house and on my patio. I tried it this morning while listening the Tibetan deep aum (om) music and the sound was absolutely horrendous as I could hardly hear anything besides the crackling. I read that others have had problems with the cracking/crackling sounds and such problems can be caused by multiple factors including the distance between the speaker and the equipment to which it is paired. In my case, the speaker crackled even when I was within three feet of my TV. I'm not sure whether the crackling occurs because the JBL Flip 4 model inherently performs poorly with low-frequency sounds or I have a defective speaker, but I am returning it due to inconsistent sound quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding battery life and super loud.,5,"Powers up and Bluetooth connection is super fast. The speaker is super loud and very clear and crisp on sound quality. It does lacks a bit on the bass, however the detail of the other instruments is outstanding. Even though I am commenting on bass being lacking, I'm very pleased with the sound quality of this tiny speaker. I work 11hrs, and have ran the speaker for the entire shift with plenty of battery leftover. The speaker being so clear and powerful, you can run it at 1/8 volume and it's plenty loud for a small office space, and I'm stating this working in a truck yard. Best purchase I've made. Highly recommend"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",2nd one,5,Great for everything since we are living in a digital age. You can stream music anywhere and hear it as if you were using iPods. Clear crisp and waterproof. My kid took the other one to school with her and it’s seems to be the life of the party .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,Very nice for size
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bueno,5,Excelente sonido
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,4,This is for outdoor use works & sounds great highly recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Perfect size, fantastic sound!",5,I love this blue tooth device!  It is just the right size and puts out great sound.  Love the camo color
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Un excelente producto de la marca reconocida,5,"Me agrada todo ,el audio ,la batería tamaño ect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I like it,5,Very good sound and pairs up easily.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Perfect for Outings, Parties, and just Chilling!",5,"This is one of the products that I bought, where I didn't know I needed it, but since it was on sale I bought it, and my oh my, I definitely needed it. I didn't realize how many situations people are in where you just need a speaker randomly. Thankfully, with its sleek and small size, I am always able to have it on me and ready to go. I've used this at parties, beach hang-outs, dance practice, and more. The sound quality is remarkable, even at max volume you can hear it from really far away. Not only is it already loud, but JBL has a group pairing option, where you can connect to another JBL speaker as well to make the sound even louder. The rich tones that this device can give makes my soul quiver, and the basses on the sides blows heavy kisses to my ear drums every beat. If you need a portable speaker this is definitely the way to go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible Sound,5,"This is my second JBL Flip 4 I have purchased and it's just an amazing speaker!  But what it is so surprising is the great sound that comes out of it.  We had bought an LG sound bar for our wall mounted TV but this little JBL beats the LG sound bar!I use this at work and it's so durable.  It's very portable and recharges easily.  Whether you have this on your desk, you take it out to the park, beach or river, this is a great little speaker that connects easily via bluetooth and puts out phenomenal sound.  You won't regret getting one of these (or two like we did)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful when it works,5,"Love this compact little speaker. I took it with me on a 10 day trip through Columbia - through the beach, city, and forest - and it worked perfectly. I've not submerged it in water but occasionally splashing it to keep it clean hasn't impacted its quality at all. As for the Bluetooth, the range seems to hold up; I've left my connected phone upstairs and it still plays well, so that does it for me.The only thing I have no positive comments on is the speakers' long-term durability. Up until today (about a month since delivery) it worked perfectly. But now, no matter how close my computer/phone is, the Flip 4 cannot play anything without skipping the audio semi-frequently. I'm hoping the issue will simply resolve itself, but this issue leaves me skeptical about the speaker durability and forces me to leave a 3-star review instead of the 5 I want to give it.Assuming I have a bug with my device (and that this issue isn't standard) I would whole-heartedly recommend this product. A clear choice over its big brother, the JBL Charge 3, for those hoping to purchase a compact, travel-friendly speaker with crisp audio.EDIT: I’ve since received a replacement and have been using it almost daily for the last year. The prior issue hasn’t occurred again, thank god. If this happens to you I hope it falls under the warranty because when the product works, it does work well. It’s survived falls and all kinds of water and still works very well (perhaps the battery drains a bit faster than originally, but nothing too crazy)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don’t waste your money,2,"I wanted to treat myself to a name brand, trusted name like JBL to avoid the same old crappy Bluetooth speakers that quit working. I was quite pleased to find this unit and after a little research, ordered one for myself!Unit #1: Speaker quit holding battery charge after less than 3 months. Would not play without being plugged into charger. After talking with the company, extensive q&a and proving to them that the unit quit working after less than three months, they gave me a new speaker AFTER I sent this one in and they could see for themselvesUnit #2: quit holding battery charge and will not play without charger plugged in after about a year.For $80 I’ll just go back to the $25 throw aways. Sorry to see a reputable company like JBL offering up junk to long time faithful customers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds works great!,5,Jbl has come along way with these speakers.It sounds great for the price
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good bluetooth connectivity/distance,3,I like the speaker for the Bluetooth connections and distance distance sounds very good up until the 3rd tier of is there of any volume setting. Honestly this is my 1st small speaker I love that it fits in any cup holder that I put it in. Good sound for a small speaker once you get to the do the top 3 tears tears of your sound on your phone tablet or whatever it kind of gets pretty plain and flat sounding to my opinion my opinion but I would definitely recommend this to somebody who is on a budget for A $100 or less speaker a speaker I'm still giving others a try so follow my review if you want for others. Also it seems right out of the box the speaker sounded like it ess blown.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great affordable speaker,5,This is a great speaker for the price. I've been cheap in the past and only bought $30-50 priced speakers and they are terrible. So I thought I'd look around the $100 range. This one is fantastic! Good battery and sound. Long charge. Portable design. Makes a big difference in enjoying music.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Bass, Awesome Speaker!",5,"My husband purchased this after careful review of many products. He is very sound oriented and extremely picky as a musician. He wanted a good-sounding speaker he  could take anywhere to listen to music and we tested many in-store for sound, not many impressed him as the bass was not good in most and often they didn't have a clear sound when turned up.This speaker arrived well packaged and worked right out the box. It charges extremely fast and hold a charge for hours. My husband said its loud enough to DJ his own backyard party and it truly is; we keep it in a box pointed away from the neighbors so we don't bother them.The speaker picks up a bluetooth signal from a pretty long distance, easily 50+ feet. It can lose signal if someone walks between the phone and speaker but quickly picks back up. My husband installed a bluetooth app on his desktop computer and can control it that way as well for a wide range of listening options. The sound is wonderful and has great bass. It picks up better range of sound than most speakers, nearly as good as the sound system he has in his music room.The speaker is well-sealed and he isn't afraid of dropping it or getting it wet by the pool. We even took it to the ocean without problems with sand or salty air. We have had the speaker a little over a month and it has hundreds of hours on it already without a hitch. We are very pleased with the product and it has made outdoor time quite pleasant."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product for the price,5,"I had the JBL Flip 3 and it got misplaced and swapped with a friend so I had to purchase a new speaker. I went to the Flip 4 since the 3 was no longer available. I'm very impressed. The price is not cheap but neither is the speaker. THe speaker is solid, dust and water resistant (at the very least if not more but I'm careful still with mine just to be safe), the sound is full and fairly loud, Bluetooth connects very fast for me on an iPhone 11 and the battery does seem to last for 10 hrs give or take on volume and type of music or podcast being played.I use my JBL at work, which is remodeling with sawdust, demo debris dust, drywall dust, in and out of the house on rainy days; and for music while riding my mountain bike, which includes vibrations, dirt and water; but the JBL has kept up through it all. For the price I wouldn't recommend anything else. Of course this is the only one I've had but I'd need convincing to go another route."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid Portable Speaker System,5,"My brother had one at his place and would use it when we played dominos on his deck.  Hearing the sound from it intrigued me as it had good bass and clear sound.  I ordered two of them for me and my family (more like one for my wife and one for the rest of us).  I used it for a cookout with my family.  I was at the grill and playing music at about two-thirds the volume for about 6 hours.  I thought I would plug it in afterwards to recharge it, when to my surprise, I realized it could have gone for another 3 hours.  Of course, depending on how high you have the volume will determine your battery life (your mileage may vary).  In short, a solid speaker - great for use on camping trips, beaches or trips to the park.  I highly recommend it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",works awesome,5,"This thing has terrific sound, easy to connect (instructions suck) and literally is nothing I would change about it.  Could you disco a dance with this, or provide music for a huge block party, no.  Can you listen to music in your backyard at pretty decent levels with a decent sound quality, yes.  The same but moreso in your house and it is a great looking little speaker.  I bought the aqua one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",But I like JBL,1,So I've owned a few and this one is faulty. It kept disconnecting and reconnecting. It's loud but not like my other ones. The battery life I guess it's ok cause I'll play it somewhat loud from 1030am to about 4 before it blinks red. The other thing is when I press the volume up it goes Bluetooth mode and when I press Bluetooth button it does nothing at all. I opened it up and found out the the wiring was short and barely connected well to the computer board like someone rigged it a bit to fit to work for a bit then this. So to avoid the disconnect and reconnect and disconnect the thing where no buttons work but the power and every once in awhile I get the Bluetooth summons lol. I guess I was dealt a bad unfortunate hand that's all. I'll still buy another I just pray it works like my other JBL flip camo that I lost and grabbed this one cause the price was nice. I have it but always have to use my phone to operate it far as volume n such.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's the perfect mini speaker,5,"I have preciously purchased the JBL Clips for listing to music in the shower and they work great. I guess others think they are pretty great too as I have had 2 of them stolen.  So I thought I would try something different this time around and I was pleasantly surprised.  The Bluetooth connectivity is way better with this model.  I used to have to wait a bit or manually connect when someone else had previously been connected.  With this its instantaneously and you can connect multiple devices at once. Example: It's Sunday morning, my brother was taking a shower listening very to music and you could hear it through the door. My mom was in the kitchen cleaning or something when she decided to listen to Sunday Mass on her phone.  And because both of their devices where connected mass started playing over my brothers music.  He was confused and angry because he couldn't get it to stop and my mom was confused because she couldn't hear anything and I just watched from the living room with glee.Two thumbs up I def recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the sound,5,Very easy to connect and the sound is awesome.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best waterproof speaker I’ve had that I haven’t lost or broken,5,"I judge my waterproof speakers against whether or not they can hold up to our wild tubing trips where you’re pretty much baking in the sun all day and getting pretty tipsy. This speaker hit rocks, was dropped in the water against them and the cooler multiple times as well as stayed in the direct sun at 90 something degrees for over 5 hours without even using half of its battery life or disconnecting once. I have UE speakers and other brands that didn’t hold up to halfway down the river and therefore will stick with my JBL. Sounds strange to mention but a lot of outdoor water / shockproof speakers don’t come with a little loop for holding them or strapping them onto something and this one does and it’s sturdy it’s not some piece that unscrews. Love this JBL and look forward to grabbing a few more to pair up with for our next trip!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Exactly what I ordered,5,"The sound is good.  It was a gift for a professional musician in a causal setting, but it's always critical.  She had selected what she wanted without a price as the primary criteria.  Appears to be quite study and easy to work with."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Louder than expected,5,"Very satisfied. Good sound, plenty of volume, compact, and good battery life. Charges pretty fast too."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,Takes a beating.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"This portable Bluetooth speaker is great. I can work outside on my projects or lounge in the pool & listen to all of my favorite music. It’s loud enough for me to hear my podcasts while I’m busy cleaning, going from room to room. Excellent purchase, worth the $$."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Yes it comes with a charger cable, its sturdy and waterproof with string handle",5,"This is my first ever JBL Bluetooth speaker and I am very satisfied ?? the size is perfect the shape, whichever way its turned it'll sit, and its waterproof ?? . The sound quality is crisp and loud, I actually use it in my car due to it not have an auxiliary nor BT. The battery lasts pretty long, at most I've let it play loudly for about 3hrs, I'm one of those people that charges things like this when I'm done using it by default also. Bluetooth is easy to connect, press the Bluetooth button on the speaker, turn on the BT on your phone or device, you should get a pairing code or pair prompt and its connected. I usually have my phones volume all the way up and adjust the speakers volume.If the mini/smaller JBL speakers are loud enough to use at a small gathering I'm sure this size will do justice for more.Overall I really like this speaker and yes I do recommend this brand"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Received a cool flip 5 even though i ordered a flip 4… oh well.,4,??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",An Absolute Steal??,5,"It's a good Ass Speaker. I've had this for about 2 months and here's what I like and don't like.Pros:Sound is Good, The Highs are loud and clear, and the lows were surprisingly good too. The bass was my Biggest concern but it delivered. It's punchy and present on the songs and you'll enjoy it as long as your not too far away from it. The Battery life is really good. Alot of reviews says theyres was bad but I only charged mines like 5x in 2 months. It's really portable as well it fits right in your hands. My fav thing to do with this is sit down and smoke some good weed with some Good music in the back??Cons:I just wish there was a better Base for the speaker on the bottom of it that way its easier to place down."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for the price.,5,The Sound quality out of this speaker is pretty decent for its size.  And it is waterproof.  It works great for going out on my paddleboard or kayak.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,We just installed our new hot tub/ spa - when we purchased the spa - out dealer advised us to not purchase the optional speakers and sound system - so we decided that we would buy a Bluetooth speaker-we went with the JBLSo far we are completely satisfied with all aspects of this device- the connectivity to our current system and to Alexa was super simple.  The sound quality is fantastic - and the fact that it’s waterproof (within reason) even sweetens the deal.  I can’t speak to battery life -but even on partial charge it lasted over 6 hoursAs a bonus - I connected it to my phone and use the speaker while playing in my UTVThis little speaker would be great in any situation that you want completely portable can’t have a wired connection
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",El producto salió malo,4,"El producto no me agrado porque no dura las 12 horas de batería cargada, lo uso para escuchar música en mi trabajo pero se descarga muy rápido la batería y lo quiero regresar, pero también quiero comprar otra para un familiar , pero como lo recomiend9 si solo dura como 5 o 6 horas de carga"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Way better than i thought!,5,This speaker packs so much punch! I bought another speaker that was cheaper first and decided to spend the extra money to get this. At half volume it has more juice than the others. Awesome speaker!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Stereo Sound,5,This Flip 4 has great true stereo sound. Nice rich bass for a speaker this size. Great quality build. Easy connection to Bluetooth. Long lasting battery. Perfect for my office. Great value for the quality speaker you get.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,3,"Sounds better than my Sony, but not as much base as Charge 4"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful,5,Great power with clear bass and tonal quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Que sigan comprando,5,Muy buena
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best speaker!,5,"I’ve had my JBL speaker for about eight months now. I’m still blown away by this speaker’s ability. It sounds incredible. I’ve tried many speakers in the past but none have come close to this. Before buying the JBL I had actually purchased a Beats speaker. I wasn’t sure which to go with at first and wanted to compare the Beats speakers with JBL. When I put them side by side, I could not tell any difference at first in the sound. I probably am a bit of an audiophile so I’m always looking for that clear, crisp sound. After spending some time with the speakers, I came to the conclusion that JBL sounded crisper or more pleasant to my ears. Not to confusion its loudness with its clarity I do think there is without a doubt a noticeable difference between the two. To get another opinion on the matter I asked a relative to do a blind sound test. I placed the two speakers in front of her and asked her to keep her eyes closed. She was to pick out the one that sounded more pleasant to her ears. Between each song I flipped the speakers around. I shuffled through different music genres. 3 times out of 5 she kept picking the JBL. Needless to say, the Beats speaker was quickly sent back. I’m happy with my decision. I will probably purchase more JBL speakers in the future."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Generally a great speaker for the price,4,"This is generally a great speaker for the price. There are a few confusing aspects though. For example, there is mention of stereo mode. And there appears to be two speakers, one on each end. But that is not what they are referring to. You can set two of these up in stereo mode with one for the left and the other for the right -- pretty expensive just to get stereo sound. You can also add several more speakers to increase room coverage for events.The smartphone app is not useful, at least in my case. For one thing it cannot find my speaker at all. I have seen suggestions that a firmware update is necessary. That is a terrible design. JBL advertises the app for that speaker and I downloaded the app the same day I bought the speaker. It should just work. PERIOD. But even if it did work, it has very little functionality. It can (theoretically) discover and connect for playing music. But your Bluetooth connection will do that just as easily. You can control the addition of other speakers to create a group of speakers all connected to the same source. That may be its main purpose.One disappointment for me is that there is no equalizer or other sound control except for volume. You can go to your phone and set the EQ settings there. But I would like to be able to do it at the speaker level . Even just Treble and Bass controls would be nice. This is one function I expected to be in the app. But no."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome item,4,"I already owned one for the last year - and I love it. I wanted to put one in the larger rooms to create a fuller sound throughout the house- so I bought during cyber Monday.  Battery life isn't and issue but keeping an eye out for it is my problem.  I usually go to use and THEN discover the lack of charge.I lowered the rating of bluetooth connect as I have had difficulty that still may be operator error.  The website claims that you can connect these an unlimited amount of times - and tech sites say it's very plausible up to 7.  I now have 3 and have issues.  Inconsistent connection and clarity in certain rooms and I have questioned the battery life and considered the connection struggle the cause.No regrets! Love this item. I have taken it kayaking,  to the pool and often grab one to use at work.  My college student has been known to grab one to take into the shower instead of the phone.I choose the flip4 over the 5 because of price as well as the difference in size. The 5 is huge in comparison."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I had to buy another flip 4,5,"Update: I can now say without a doubt that the sound quality on the flip4 is superior to the UE Boom speakers. I was at my sisters house and she had the UE Boom going and all I could think is 'Where is the base?' On the flip 4 the base is rich and strong. I am so glad I have the flip 4 now. I almost bought the other.This is the second JBL flip 4 I have owned. The first one was great but the battery would no longer hold a charge after only 1.5 years of what I thought was mild usage. I broke it because I tried to replace the battery. These speakers are not built to have a battery replacement. ANYWAY , I bought it again because after suffering over the last 2 months with an Anker bt speaker that cost about 30 bucks I wanted my flip 4 back. I missed the beautiful base and over all sound quality. The speaker arrived in the mail today and I'm in heaven. All my favourite songs on pandora have come back to life because of it! The short overall battery life sucks but the sound on this speaker is what makes this second purchase the right choice. My sister has these huge UE bt speakers and I swear i like the flip 4 more than i like them. I think the base is more impressive but then, that's me.  By the way these are made  by Harmon Kardon. Thanks for reading."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"Let’s start off with the things I don’t like. First to support the cons, you need to know that this speaker is quite compact and isn’t this huge speaker to be able to create a large bass sound. This leads me to my one con. I’m not one to listen to a lot of bass heavy music but this speaker doesn’t have the most bass. In it’s class, I do believe that this speaker takes the win for bass. It does have bass though for listening to just about anything.Now to talk about the pros, on the exterior appearance and ruggedness of the speaker, this thing is great. I have the ocean blue and it is quite a sexy color. I bought the gray one before and gave it to my brother and his is still kickin’. The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless without a doubt. The battery life stands tall and it doesn’t take forever to charge. I can even use a portable battery pack to charge it and it charges even faster. If you keep the volume at about half it lasts quite long.Overall, I don’t have anything bad to say about the speaker. It truly is a good speaker and I’m sure if you run into any problems, JBL or amazon will be glad to clear it up for you."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome battery life awesome sound quality I recommend buying at least 2 or 4,5,Well before I begin I will say that I had already done my research and I already knew that the quality of sound was awesome what I did not expect was that when they claim it has 12 hours battery life at moderate volume levels they were not kidding I have run this thing up to 14 hours not had a single bit of problems its Bluetooth connectivity is great depending on the phone to you might have to look for it once in awhile but it always gets connected and stays connected to my phone when you're running multiple speakers for some reason on YouTube it seems to have some issue switching from one song to the next I discovered later on that this is a range between speaker 1 and speaker 2 if you have it too far away it will try to break up so I recommend keeping them within six feet of each other however the seeming connection issues always resolves itself within a few seconds of the next song beginning audio quality is awesome you really don't need the JBL app with them but if you want it feel free to use it I run mine without and I get perfect left and right stereo I was using a Samsung Galaxy phone I'm now using a moto Z3 and having no issues at all
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality sound,5,Excellent quality sound. Very happy with purchase
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound for the money.,5,"Arrived early, package well protected, easy to setup & use. Sounds great right out of the box. Haven’t had it long so can’t speak to the longevity."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Updated review 2021,5,"This is a bittersweet review: I purchased this speaker in June of 2017, and for 14 months, this has been an outstanding little speaker. Sound is crisp, rich and bold. It is indeed water resistant and has held up under many different conditions, including the Florida heat and inclement weather. I don't know if I used it a bit more than the average consumer (20 to 30 hours a week), but in the past 30 days, I've noticed the battery life diminishing exponentially. Today (after a full charge last night), the battery was completely drained after 2 hours of use. The only other complaint I had prior to this, is that the charging cable broke at about the 9 month mark. So in summation, it may be that I just used it to ""death"", however for the $90+ paid for the device, I am very disappointed to not experience much greater longevity.Am leaving my 2018 review above that was three stars, as Amazon won't let me add a second review for my most recent five star purchase. Anyway, I returned to the JBL flip (camo 2021 version) after we ran over over our UEBoom speaker & the prices on that brand are stupid now. The new JBL is actually better than the Boom we're replacing (and I rated the Boom higher it than the old JBL). I don't know if the JBL has been improved, or if we just used the Boom to death, but... the base is richer/deeper now than the Boom & brass tones are crisper. Maybe I'm fickle and will return to another product later, but if this one can last a year, I'll call it good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",it's SO good! better than more recent versions,5,"the quality is fabulous AND it still comes with the aux ability so I can plug it into my laptop and my hard of hearing husband can hear beautifully. this means that if you have a device that doesn't connect via Bluetooth (it happens), you can still have great sound. They don't last forever, but the last I had lasted at around 5 years. SO happy I found another flip4!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound and the connectivity when you have more than 1 linked,5,Amazing sound and the connectivity when you have more than 1 linked
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound and Battery - Not great pairing with the JBL app,4,"The speaker sounds great and has fantastic battery life. However, I bought this to pair it with my JBL charge and the results are just okay. When they are paired and it's working smoothly, the sound between the two is AWESOME! I was a little disappointed at the connectivity though. The speakers must be in close proximity to each other and close proximity to the phone or device playing the music. I would say they can be about 25-30 ft from each other and the device you're playing music from has to be dead center. This is my only complaint, if you move the speakers any further, or walk off with your phone even a little, you'll notice clipping and unpairing. It's a little annoying because when you walk back into range, the speakers dont automatically reconnect, you have to manually go back into the app and re-pair. Battery life is incredible, this weekend I had just this one speaker going at about 100% for an easy 4-5 hours and still had plenty of battery life left."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",its a great option for a speaker,5,I got this because i needed a loud speaker to listen to music while i work out and this could not be any better. Its a great option for a cheap speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A Solid Choice,5,"I've been wanting a portable speaker for a while now and finally broke down to get one before our vacation this year. After a decent amount of research, this one kept coming up in the top 3 or top 5 portable speakers on the market. And I liked it best because of it's price point.I tried it out while watching movies and listening to music, and it does a great job at both. I have not yet tried out the speakerphone or the JBL Connect app, but I didn't get it for a speakerphone and I'm not planning on getting another one so no need for the app to link others for ""party mode"".These do a great job though for movies and music. An impressive, full sound out of this little thing that surprised me. I've only had the volume cranked up about 2/3 of the way and it was pretty loud. Full blast will definitely fill the house and make it loud enough for small parties.The sound is clear and full, produces plenty of bass from these small speakers and has a nice range from the highs to the lows. I watched a few movies with my daughter and was impressed hearing all the little details like people walking, to the excitement of a full explosion that filled the room. Instead of doing what I needed to, I kept finding myself distracted with watching a movie that I've seen 100 times because the audio was so good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best ever,5,I have not charged it since I did when I got it. It is very vibrant (I got the red) and it works so well. I can feel the base in my soul (lol). I have never owned a better speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive Sound,4,"Very impressed with the sound.  I was on the fence about whether to get this or the Charge 3.  Video reviews of the sound seemed accurate in that the Charge 3 delivers better bass but is otherwise murky.  And even though I like full sound with bass, I think the Flip 4 is the better option for music lovers who value tones.  I'd say the bass out of this is ""enough"" to satisfy.  It's also smaller and more portable, which I like.  If I travel, it won't take up much room in a suitcase.The BT range is very good, as expected. It pairs easily.  I like that the sound is very good no matter how you place or stand it. Battery life seems excellent though I haven't run it for more than a couple of hours at a time. I haven't tested its water handling abilities (and probably won't, it wasn't a factor in my decision)ONE CON:There is one annoying thing about this speaker:  When you turn it on, it makes a very loud and obnoxious guitar strum sound (and the same when you turn it off).  You cannot turn this off, mute it, or lower its volume.  I have no idea why JBL put this in.  I'm not sure why others haven't complained about this a lot more but they need to put out a firmware update to get rid of it or at least allow you to change the tone to something quieter or simple like a low ding."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounding and no problems,5,"My son bought this for me because I am constantly streaming music and radio from my phone and I really like it! Over the years I've had JBL car and home speakers and I wore out three sets of the same model JBL sport earbuds. I can rely on JBL to provide great sound for the price and this bluetooth speaker delivers. I liked my first one so much that I bought three more so my wife and I and a couple good friends can each have one when we're sitting around listening to music and talking. For a real sound treat, rest your head on a high-backed chair and rest the speaker on the ""crown"" of your skull with the front of the speaker aimed down towards your ears. The vibrations and sound will make you feel like you're sitting in the middle of the band! It's amazing!!!????????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery on mines came defective,3,Its a good speaker and im sure its only mine that came defective the battery only lasted around an hour after only 50% of the volume was being used its rated for 12 hrs but i guess mines just didnt work and yes i charged it day and night and it still ran out of charge fast but other than that the sound quality is great and kind of loud id recommend to some who are on a budget and want something portable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very pleased!,5,Great sound quality from such a small speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great speaker sound and quality even the box is top notch love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love listening to my music,5,"I had many speakers in my room, but Jbl is one of the best i bought in a while. I love my music day and night and couldn't be happier ????????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Sound Quality,4,"This is the first JBL of my life and I'm loving it. Sound quality has been superb and so far, I have hardly gotten anything to complain against apart from the battery life. The battery does seem to burn out a little quicker than what I expected it to, but, then again, this is the just a small compromise I had to make in order to take advantage of the best sound quality any bluetooth speaker can offer me.Connecting to the speaker has been seamless. It connects with both my laptops as well as my smartphone. This one also comes with JBL Connect+ feature which means that it can connect to other JBL bluetooth speakers with JBL Connect+ feature. And if you're partying (which, I'm sure, you would do quite often during weekends), you can connect all the JBL bluetooth speakers with JBL Connect+ feature, amplify the party music and start partying even harder!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery issues,5,Almost 3 yrs later & battery wont stay charged
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Grat for when you want music outside,5,"We use this when eating or just general entertaining on our patio. Easily connects to our cell phone via Bluetooth. Great sound and the battery stays charged all evening. This is our second one. We lost our first one (don't ask, it is an ugly story) and liked it so much we bought another. I would recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",awesome for outside activities,5,"I ordered this waterproof Bluetooth speaker to take with me while kayaking and it does not disappoint! It fits perfectly in the bottle holder forward of the seat. During the latest kayak trip a small storm rolled in causing choppy waters. As the waves buffeted my small craft the speaker was drenched in water. It even sat in standing water as the bottle holder filled up. Nonetheless it continued playing the entire time without any problem. It has great sound for being about the size of a pint beer can. It won't fill up a room, but it isn't meant to. For the beach, water sports, biking, hiking, and all kinds of outdoor and indoor activities where you want portable sound, this is great! Also, you can apparently connect up to 100 of these together and have them all play from the same source. I might get another...Update: got another speaker and have been unable to pair them together in stereo mode! The app that you need to get them to work together is terrible! Reduced my rating from 5 stars down to 3 because of the abysmal app.Update 2: finally figured out why it wasn't working. Only one speaker should be paired with your device. I had them both paired with my phone. It works now, but it was a pain in the ass figuring it out. The app isn't very use friendly..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",THIS SPEAKER ENDURED LIFE THREATENING FLOAT TRIP CHAOS,5,"Let me tell the epic tale.First, word of advise from the wise, when you take this gem of a speaker on a float trip, you must attach it to a life jacket or some sort of floatation accessory. You won’t be sorry.Second, my canoe flipped and was pinned under a tree against a strong current for over an hour as we worked to retrieve the canoe and our belongings. I lost clothes, sunglasses, my ball cap, and my pocket knife, but not the JBL- because it was strapped to my life jacket which floated downstream once the canoe was pulled from the tree.I turned on the JBL and it worked as if nothing happened. It synced up to my phone without hesitation. The speakers worked like normal. IM AMAZED. My friends I floated with were just as amazed as I was, and we continued jammin’ all the way down the river thanks to the creators of the ever-so-durable JBL. I love JBL. I will continue to love and promote JBL to my friends and family."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Amazing sound, but costs $$ to pair with another JBL speaker",4,"I love the sound quality, the size and heft (the way it feels just being held in your hand, very balanced), and the durability.  I bought it for one child because older sibling loves hers.  I also bought it so they could “pair” the speakers, but it turns out their speakers can’t be paired without add app that costs money to buy, and I think it involves an ongoing subscription too.Overall the speaker is excellent!  Great value for the money.  I gave 4 stars because of the issues with linking, and it’s inconvenient enough that I’d give only 3 stars in this review, but I feel that would misrepresent this JBL speaker.  It totally deserves a 5-star review, and if the company can contact me with a solution, I’ll gladly raise the rating to 5 ??????????!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW! Amazing sound quality!,5,"I knew the reviews were amazing but I wasn't prepared for the sound quality given this is a waterproof speaker.  We got this for our pool and with the sounds of the kids playing and the filter going, it gets pretty loud but the music is crystal clear and the battery lasts all day if charged the night before.  LOVE this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loves it,5,Love it nice sound and holds a charge for a long time also nice to travel with
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nowhere near as loud as the Ultimate ears equivalent.,4,"Nowhere near as loud as the Ultimate ears equivalent. I still enjoy the speaker, but there are better and louder options out there. I use this for music to workout with in my front yard, and do yardwork. It does the job."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!!!!!,5,"I loved my JBL Flip 3 but one day it just stopped taking a charge and I knew I'd have to move on...  I got this Flip 4 (camoflauge pattern) as a gift and absolutely love it.  It is noticeably smaller than the previous models but the sound is still the same. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that other brands have - i.e. the ability to stream music or change with remotes etc [at least not that I can see].  It is a great speaker for someone who doesn't use technology as there are only 4 button; power, volume up, volume down and blue tooth.  My least favourite change between the models is when I'm pairing it with a device, the volume is controlled in unison. Indont know how to articulate it other than to write Ibused to be able to control the volume on my phone separately from the speaker but now if I turn it up on the phone, it is up on the speaker, so it feels like there is less total volume.  What i like better is that when I am connecting a device and the speaker power is on, it I choose to pair it with the Flip4 it automatically connects with out me having to turn the bluetooth on the speaker and time it together."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I’m very happy with my purchase.,5,The JBL Flip 4 is definitely a great find. So lovin it!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent buy!,5,Excellent sound quality and very durable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's worth he money,5,This one is true you get what you pay for.. Bought a cheap $49 speaker from Costco it was cute it light up and flashed but sounded like Crap.. This Flip4 sounds nice more like using my Samsung earbuds. It does get a bit distorted when you bring it to max volume but sounds good just under max. Can not say for battery life or long term use yet but I am happy with the purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,"Lots of good reviews. Bought for work. Absolutely love. Loud and clear quality. I do construction, depending on noise level and turning on/off to talk with people battery has gone as long as 4 days. Definitely worth the money"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great small speaker.,5,"Jbl is best.  Have a giant one use in my bar and now this small one for the pool!!  Great sound quality. Great bass. Very easy to connect to music source ( phone , tablet etc). Jbl speakers also connected wirelessly and almost on their own together to add seams sound system.  Great value and my opinion best on the market"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality is top notch,5,"What’s not to like? Great sound and bass. Waterproof 100%, easy to connect and outstanding battery life. We use it by the pool and it sounds like we have a full band in ourMidst."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds decent for it's size,3,"I would say for it's size it has a lot of bass. I like it for what it is and being very portable and small. Compared to real speakers, it's not great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get it…you’ll love it!,5,I needed a new speaker to use with my iPhone while teaching a class at the gym.  This speaker is perfect.  It puts out a LOT of quality sound.  The ladies in my class noticed a big difference in the sound right away and commented on how much better it was!  It’s great and cost a lot less than my Bose speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blown speaker,2,"Bought this for ambient noise at work and used lightly at home ( just a handful of times), speakers never fully cranked. After a few uses the speakers started making a "" womping "" sound and its past the return window. Save your dough and buy another speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonky battery life,4,"This is the second one I've had.  With the first one, I would plug it back in for charging at the end of the night.  I didn't check to see how many battery life lights were on.  Well, it probably started dying within a year.  Bought this second one, because I like the size and sound, but I don't plug it in for charging until way after the red light comes on.  It has lasted for over 2 years now, but this battery is now starting to lose charge quickly also.  I ordered a new battery and I plan to swap that out with the battery in the first one to see what happens.  :-)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good quality,5,It is worth to spend a little bit more money for very good quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Nice....It's just not as loud as I'd like it to be.,4,Sounds Nice and seems to work well.  I was just hoping it was a little louder.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,Great product. Great price and booming good sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","12 hour battery life, yea whatever..more like 6.5-7",4,The only way you’ll get 12 hours of battery life is to turn it off for a hour or two then turn it back on
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,Perfect patio speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,"Great battery life, Great sound quality, And nice bass. I recommend this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker does everything as advertised.,5,"The sound is very good for a little speaker.  I had the chance to see one without the cover and the baffles inside seem to be of good quality.Not to mention that if you drop it accidentaly in your pool, you can recover it and keep using it because it has a good grade on waterproof.I use it mostly on my bike, placing it the same way as another water bottle.  The sound is great and this way I avoid using headphones, and allows me to listen to the music I like during the route.Battery duration is great as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof Portable Speaker Update,5,Great product at such an affordable price. We took it to the beach. It has great sound and very easy to use.UPDATE: Look out for trying to register this product. It’s a long tedious process.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love This Little Speaker!,5,"Overall...I love this little speaker! I use it a lot and am impressed how long the battery charge lasts even at loud volumes (which exhaust the battery charge faster). Yes - you can find larger units that have greater volume and bass response, but for the price of this small speaker...it sounds pretty darned good! Very happy with this purchase and would recommend to family and friends...:)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great choice,5,Good clear sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great price amazing sound,5,We love this new addition for family lake days floating around and jamming. Amazing sound for a great price not to mention the battery lasts all day while in the water!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Compact, great sound and quality feel",5,"After testing some lower quality Bluetooth speakers, I decided to try this one. A coworker has one, one day she was using it and I was amazed at the sound quality, bass, compactness.The speaker is waterproof too, a great feature. The buttons are low profile and work well. It has 2 speakers with bass radiator on both ends.You can stand it up vertically or lay it horizontal. Vertical gives a wider sound field, and either way if you put it in a corner or under cupboards it improves the bass response.The sound clarity and quality are very good. It can get quite loud without distorting. The compact size is great to use around the house or outdoors, and easy to put in your bag when you leave the house.$80 seems more costly but I figured I’d buy higher quality that I like vs just buying something basic that I later want to upgrade.This also pairs fast and re-pairs quickly. A gripe I have is that you can’t change songs/tracks with the speaker buttons. You have to use your phone. A second gripe is that it won’t show the remaining battery life on your phone screen. But there are 5 blue dots by the power button that show the battery level.Overall, I love it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip4,5,"Awesome product! I needed a small speaker for the dock in the summer. This is great because I don’t have to worry if me or the kids knock it in the water! Worth the money. Compact, but packs awesome sound! The camouflage is cool too, connects in about 3 seconds."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My speaker has a lisp,2,This product looks great and I was very excited as I love my little speaker clip on that I plugged it into my phone. I thought the quality of sound would be better on this because it’s more expensive and much larger I was wrong. Every word with an S sounds out like an SH so sad sounds like shat For example. I’m not sure if I have a defective device or if the sound quality is just bad… It’s a shame it looks so cool and I was happy to have another JBL product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound,5,Golfcart
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My Prized Possesion,5,"This speaker is probably the most durable thing I own. I’ve left it in the rain and the extreme heat, spilled juice on it, and even dropped it from more than five feet out of a moving vehicle. The pictures are from about a year of this use and abuse and there are barely any marks or dents.The volume carries so it’s great for parties and the work environment. It’s the perfect size, It fits just in my hand. I even strap it to my backpack when I run or hike and I only  the strap it comes with. This thing is built to last.-Quick charging time- Easy to connect to phone and other JBL speakers- Very durable- Clear sound quality with superior bass you can feelI’ve had this speaker for about a year and it’s just as good as the first day! To this day, I get compliments on this speaker people want to buy it off of me"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It reaches my expection.,4,It connected with my laptop?works good.it’s a pity with micro USB but not typeC.And its not so easy to open charging cover…
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker Would Purchase Again!!,5,Very loud for the size with a nice bass it has a long lasting battery span. It’s also protective cause it fell hard a couple of times and didn’t fall apart. Would recommend if your clumsy like me.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works,5,Great quality speaker for the money. Durable with good battery life and a great sound. Used for 3 months and no issues. I bought multiple speakers last year and none of them lasted? This is good value enjoy the tunes!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bon appétit very good,5,Wow this speaker is SPICY. Get the party going or being the party with YOU. Now dats a spicy meataball! 10 out of 10 recommend :)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absurdly high quality.,5,"I'm a teenager and this was a fraction of one of my paychecks. I was worried that for so cheap it would be pretty...cheap, but the reviews convinced me to take a chance. I'm glad I did. This thing is sufficiently loud and has a good Bluetooth range (approx. 40 feet). I brought it to work, let it play for a 6 hour Friday shift, forgot it over the weekend, and then played it for a second 6 hour shift the following Monday, so you KNOW that battery is good. I'm not being paid to say this at all, but I legitimately think I might purchase a second one since I know they can sync up and play the same audio on two devices for double the sound. Great speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Happy With It,5,I use this in my 1948 Dodge to connect my phone and listen to Spotify 50s playlists while I am out driving.  My kids borrow it all the time.  We use for outdoor party tunes all the time.  Years on and it still hold sit charge quite long.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small and powerful,5,"Got this mainly for small groups/events such as back yard, pool and river floats. Easy to connect to and great quality for the settings intended. Don't expect this to be the sole speaker for a house party or anything but it does have the ability to pair and sync sound with most JBL speakers so you could have more spread sound.Our first outing with it was at a river float trip in Austin with 5 people and it provided enough sound for us all despite all the other sound around us. And it could get a little splash here and there and I wasn't worried as long as it didn't submerge. (though should have been fine for a bit had it been submerged due to its water resistance rating)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and price!!,5,"We’ve really enjoyed taking this speaker to the park this summer. It’s compact, but powerful. Great, clear sound! After researching several speakers, we’re glad we purchased this one!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality and bass!,5,"Great features and sound quality. Worth the money. Only drawback is the max volume is not deafining. Its greats for a small room or porch, but in the wide open like beach or lawn, it is not going to blow you away. Just had to adjust expectations, for the size, it is great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Did not work for stereo pairing with another JBL Flip 4 using Connect+,2,"I bought this as a second JBL Flip 4 so I could have a wireless stereo setup in my room.  The product advertises being able to use the the Connect+ with another unit of the same model in stereo mode where when there are two units and you configure stereo mode in the JBL app and assign left and right it will send left channel to just one unit and right to the other.  This mode is very very flakey and no matter what I tried (including updating firmware, factory reset etc.) it would plan both left and right channels from one unit and only of of the two channels from the other.  This feature is not implemented properly and I'm surprised they still advertise this feature without fixing the bug in a firmware update (I updated both to the latest firmware).  Ended up returning it and buying a powered pair of bookshelf speakers and ran the wire across the room (what I was trying to avoid)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality as expected!,5,Great for golf.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Easy to connect with the  phone,  computer.....Sound clear, the voice also."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So Good I Bought It Again,5,"I had one of these speakers stolen from my truck and initially replaced it with a crappy Beats speaker that didn't last a year. I'm not making that mistake twice, so I bought a second JBL Flip. This speaker is well worth the money: good volume and sound quality, decent battery life, and very durable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","4 Stars For Price, Sound Quality, Range & Size",4,"I needed a small, bluetooth enabled speaker with good range that is well priced, sounds good and has decent battery life. This did the trick. Ive had it a couple of months with no complaints. Since I do not use it outside I cannot speak to its water resistant capabilities however it is doubtful I would take it with me on a shark diving tour or to a tropical beach excursion during monsoon season. On the other hand; if you do choose to take it with you on what is billed as a three hour tour and become lost at sea then I suppose the red Flip could be used a signal buoy. I am fairly certain that is why jbl offers one in that color. The lanyard is a nice touch, makes transportation from here to there more convenient if you have tiny hands and cannot grasp the speaker itself. I did not try the jbl connect app. Stopped dead in my tracks upon reading the eula where it says google analytics will manage data collected by the app, plus you have to allow the app to know your location. Why does anyone need to know my location as a condition for modifying settings on the Flip and what ""analytics"" are collected by goozle? If you're looking for comments regarding sound quality or comparisons then you will find several good amazon reviews that cover those points."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good speaker, low life",4,"This is the best looking and best sounding speaker I've ever owned...Except for the battery life. On a full charge, you get maybe an hour of music. Even if you plug it in and try to play music, it dies.Please fix that, and the speaker would be perfect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best output considering the price!,5,"This is by far the great Bluetooth speaker I've owned.I am from India and I purchased this when I was at business trip to US.Earlier I was using Mi Bluetooth speaker which was kind of bass heavy and because of that vocals as well as highs were not so good.I've seen some of my friends using Flip 2 and Flip 3 which also has some great sound quality so I also wanted to buy one from JBL.As the recent model is Flip 4, I started watching reviews on YouTube for Flip 4. I also saw comparison reviews of Flip 4 with Bose sound link as well as creative sound blaster roar.Upon comparison, I realised that Bose is too expensive for a portable Bluetooth speaker category (even though slightly better sound than this) and creative is too bulky for its job!Also, one added advantage for Flip 4 is that it's water resistant, which none of the other 2 were offering.For this price, this is really a steal deal. The bass is not too heavy but it's adequate and most importantly the sound is clear at the highest volume for low, mid and high frequency ranges along with vocals.One more thing to add, the sound at the startup of the speaker is quite good as well :)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great overall product, no aux cord",5,"The product/Speaker its self is amazing, its super portable and has amazing sound quality, i may sound like a bot but im not, i bought this speaker because i had no sound system for my pc or anything really. The speaker is really loud and lasts a long time, id say atmost a good 12 hours. I use this speaker when im out at the beach, the pool, the park, in the shower, or just in my room. The sound quality is great and you can really hear the ?base/bass? It doesnt take all that long to charge either and you can take it anywherem In all honesty, if your thinking of getting a speaker this is a really great choice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,We bought this for our golf cart. It sounds great and very clear
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent for the price,4,Like that it’s water proof and has speaker phone.  Not as clear as my Bose
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Horrible,4,"The battery life oh speaker don't stay, after charging it it all day, once taken off charging port red charging lit appears. Not happy at all with this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Bocina bo irá, bonitos colores, buen precí",5,"Suena muy bien, el color escogido es bonito"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Flip 4 is a great little stereo speaker!,5,"It pairs easily with Android or iPhone (using SS Galaxy S10 and Power Amp as player). Very few speakers tell you they are mono only so I was happy to find the Flip 4 is stereo. Rarely will there be other devices linked so the stereo version is a good choice for me. This is great for on the go travel, garage, or doing projects outside of your normal areas. Very happy with purchase and performance. It sounds great for its size. I'll buy again if something happens to it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","If you're looking for a capable bluetooth speaker that sounds good, you've found it!",5,"This is a great speaker.  Sounds bigger than it is. Charges fast and lasts a long time.  Pairs easily and sounds fantastic playing everything from Classical to Country, Rock to Reggae, and Progressive to Pop.  Although it says it is waterproof, I haven't tried to test that yet!  I'm sure it would survive a light splash or maybe a sprinkle of rain, but I'm not gonna throw it in a pool anytime soon.  I love its sound and I have dog ears.  I can hear the highs balanced with the lows.  Typically a speaker this small won't have any bass, but this speaker does fine.  Can use it as a speakerphone, there's an app where you could link dozens of them to listen to a single source, which would be great in a party environment.  Overall, this was a great product and I have yet to keep it a full volume for long since it gets louder than I need. When outdoors it is easily heard within 20 feet and not overbearing or sounding overblown.  Bass doesn't tend to fuzz out on this even with battery usage towards the end of charge.  I really like this little speaker for the cost and for the performance.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and use it several times a week."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,I’ve always been a fan of JBL speakers and so far all of the speakers I’ve bought including this one are really good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, heavy duty construction.",5,"Great sound, seriously water proof. I am a gardener and take it everywhere with me. I forget and leave it under a bush somewhere. The sprinklers go on, I find my Flip4 the next day. All is well.I love the light teal but maybe should have planned for large amount of dirty finger prints. I  wouldn't trade it for another JBL Flip4But I am considering getting another one because the app can link them together for mega sound experience.  Don't tell Sonos but the JFlip4 is easier for me to use and I take it everywhere.  Most people appreciate good sound but I'm polite and down blast them out ((even thought I could) serious bass for my dubstep focus playlist."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,To play music on our patio
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great so far. Love it!,5,So far very pleased. Have not used it by water yet
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,"Bought this for the purpose of taking it on a trip with me! It’s light and compact, and travels well! Sound is loud with a good bass. It was the life of the party during spring break. Connecting was easy and quick. Use it for all occasions now, I play music on it every day."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker lasted from Feb/2019 until Oct/2020,4,"I'm not an expert on sound systems, but for such a small speaker, to me it had great sound. Bluetooth worked with my laptop or my phone with no problems. Then one day I attempted to turn up the volume on the speaker itself and it made a loud almost screech sound. It still works as a speaker, but the volume is so low it is barely audible and cannot be adjusted. Not worth the money for less than 2 years' use.UPDATEI don't know what happened, but after buying another speaker to replace this one, this JBL has started working again. I'm using it with my Dell laptop so that I can control the volume from the laptop and not the speaker itself. It's been fine for about six months now, so I'll add stars to my rating."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",How is 12 hour battery life achieved?,4,"Overall this is a quite decent Bluetooth speaker but the advertised battery life confuses me. I can barely get 6 hours out of this thing which isn't even close to the advertised battery life.  I use mine in a noisy environment so I always have it cranked up to maximum volume, that might be my issue. I bet the advertised battery life is for an office worker playing it very quietly on their desk."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Meets My Needs,5,"4 months into owning this with moderate usage 3-4 times a week. I use this in my backyard, on the golf course, while working, excercising, for fun times.  The sound is full and well balanced, top heavy on the bass a bit, I'd like more mids, but that's really picky. I love quality audio and this meets my needs at this price. It's not going to rock a big party, but has even output to fill a room. Connectivity works for pairing my phone. You can pair two devices, but when they are paired together, nothing plays, so one needs to disconnect. Battery is true and I'd guess good for 6 hours of playback. Feels sturdy, I'm considering buying a 2nd one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,I gave this to one of my girls as a gift and she loves it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for the price!,5,"Considering the price, this is an awesome speaker! Of course, you can find some with better sound quality, greater volume, etc. but those speakers will easily cost you over $100. The sound quality and volume out of this speaker is great; comparable to a Bose Mini Soundlink (a speaker that is almost twice the price, and is not waterproof), and you really can't beat that.The waterproof functionality has worked well for me, although there was a brief period where I probably soaked it one too many times in the shower; the speaker would sporadically turn on and off back and forth multiple times throughout the day (very annoying). However, a day or two of leaving it alone and plugged in solved that issue (no issues since).The bluetooth connectivity is extremely fast and the button functionality is great! I love the feature where you can double-press the ""play"" button to skip to the next song. And of course, given the waterproof nature of it, it is great for outdoor adventures (beach days, kayaking/rafting, camping, etc.)Overall, well worth the money!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good!,4,"It is good but it defo doesn’t sounds like JBT 4. It doesn’t have much of that beat sounds. When it is loud, it makes that annoying noise. So I am not much happy but good product"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I bought mine July 2018 and today in Jan 2021 I had my first issue...,5,"It sound amazing. no issues taking it into the shower, on the bike... the strap that comes with it is sturdy and the jbl flops around on the handle bars, the rubber that protect the edges get use..Today the JBL would power on but would not make the sound that it's powered on.. I looked at the bluetooth on my phone and that was working, the volume and play button all functioned, but still no sound.I tried to factory reset (power on-press and hold both play and volume up bottom simultaneously until power off) , but still no sound.The fix was this: press and hold power button for 10-20 seconds... even after power lights flash.regardless, if this was a permanent issue that I could not resolve, i wouldnt mind buying another really."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lasts me Almost 2 years so far,5,"I bought this in august of 2018... I still use this, and it’s May of 2020. That’s called craftsmen-ship. I haven’t ever seen any other Bluetooth speaker for less than a hundred dollars last over a couple months. I first actually bought this because I saw how long it’s been lasting my uncle. When I bought mine(almost 2 years ago) my uncles JBL flip 3 was I believe either 2 or 3 years old then!!! He still uses it and it’s treated him well. I’ve done my own little forms of(not quite stress-tests) but more towards feature checks. I tested if it’s waterproof and indeed I have brought it in my neighbors pool for a pool party’s last July(a year after I initially bought it) and it still was waterproof(and it says something when I dropped my Iphone X in there and it stopped working immediately and it’s rated for 3m). Everything it says it can do, it’s done so far. Definitely would recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Great sound quality. Would buy again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Submerged 48 hours! Still works!,5,"I use my Flip4 when I’m in the hot tub…leave it playing on the edge of the tub…love it. Last night I went out for a soak and realized I’d closed the lid and knocked the thing into the tub when I got out last time.?? So there it sat on the bottom of the tub for 2 days (and no, it doesn’t float!). Figured it was a gonner. Let it dry out overnight, plugged it into the charger for awhile this morning and turned it on. Expected nothing but it fired right up. It still works and sounds great! Not going to make a habit of storing it under water but glad to know it really is waterproof. ????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great for work, needs more bass",4,I love the ease of use and connectivity but I wish it had a little more base sound I end up throwing a towel on top of it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice design.,4,"Good sound quality, bluetooth connectivity is fine. The battery life is the issue here, it's not bad, but it's not good either."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 - #1 Portable Speaker on Amazon,5,"This beats the Douni A5.  It's smaller, compact but throws big sound.  Not obnoxiously too loud, but loud enough.  I put it on full blast, playing some heavy bass music and it stood the test.  The speakers did not blow out, which I had a problem with my Douni A5.Bluetooth pairs so easy with my iphone.  No stubborn connection at all.  I like the hidden buttons on my camo colored JBL speaker.  The control buttons are in black, but they are embossed, so you can feel them and not have to look where you are pressing.Its at a decent price, less than $100, which is great.  I'm really enjoying it and hopefully it'll last a long time.I'll update this if it bugs out.  Hopefully it'll match the #1 rated spot on Amazon for a portable speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Looking for big sound from a small device?,4,"I bought this Flip 4 to replace an aging Aomais Sport II that was now giving me 2 hours of playtime and the last hour was fuzzy noise. The size of the JBL Flip 4 threw me it’s tiny fits in my hand. The sound threw me next. It’s a very nice sounding product for what you get. My yard is pretty big, with a running waterfall at the poolside. I wanted a device that could fill pool area with music. The JBL Flip 4 handles that. Better than my last two devices.It’s downside is a lack of bass. So if you are looking for oomf for any party music you’ll be a little disappointed. Mid range vocals sound perfect though. It’s peaks are well balanced but crank it up to max and you’ll notice some distortion.I’m curious to see what 5 of these things around the pool would sound like in tandem. I suspect it would be quite nice. As it stands this one device is loud and clear enough to be heard in my backyard which is more than I expected from such a small portable.I am still looking for bigger sound so I’m checking out another device as well. But the FLIP 4 will be my de facto jogging with the wife - quick outing speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely amazing sound,5,"This small speaker has a very powerful rich and clear sound. I expected high quality sound from JBL but it exceeded all my expectations. The bass is powerful enough too. The build quality seems to be good. Even though it is rated for water submersion, I wouldn't risk it because the 3mm audio port and  the charging USB port cover doesn't seem to be watertight. Overall, it is a very good speaker, I would definitely buy it again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Batter Life Fix,4,"Not sure I didn't think of this idea before but it worked for me ...I bought this speaker last year to use while cycling and had issues with the battery life dying on me after 2 hours of play. I even when to the extent of cracking it open and replacing the battery with a supposed more powerful one...wasn't working. Then I thought, I just happen to have a small portable charger...so I charged it up...secured it on my fixie bike, connected it to my JBL FLip 4, and guess what...no issue with the speaker dying out - even after 4 hours consistent play -- even my portable charger had 75% power after 4 hours...so...get a portable charger for long-lasting play."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Does not last,2,"We loved ours for the first year and a half.It stopped charging at around the year and a half mark, so if u think 1.5 years is worth the purchase price than this is the speaker for you.I will not be buying again"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Great product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the sound and size!,5,"This speaker makes me happy!  So glad I read multiple reviews before purchasing.  I currently have 1 but may purchase another.  The sound quality is wonderful and the size is great for travel. I use this at my open houses, easy to hide behind something and the sound is solid through out the space."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,"Very easy to use, and has a very clean look. Seems and feels very well built, hopefully it will me last me a long time"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL audio outperformed UE speakers,5,"I was looking for an outdoor waterproof speaker and had narrowed my choices down to this JBL, the UE Boom 2, or the UE Wonderboom. Based on online reviews, I thought I would likely get one of the UEs, but I went to a local electronics store where all three were on display to listen to them in person. I highly recommend doing that. I watched a bunch of review and comparison videos, but hearing the speakers through a video was nothing alike to hearing them in person. When I listened to both UE products, the audio sounded like it was coming from underwater. It was muffled and lacked clarity on the mids and high tones, but both UE speakers did have good bass. The JBL was incredibly clear and had a great range. In terms of audio quality, it's hard to compare the three speakers - the JBL was that much better. I haven't had the chance to run it from full charge until it dies to test the battery, but I've used it for several hours at a time over the past two weeks and have been happy with its performance. Bluetooth connection was easy and I like having the buttons on the speaker more than I thought I would. Overall, a fantastic speaker. Highly recommended."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,5,
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Bluetooth speaker!,5,"This speaker is awesome! The battery charge lasts hours!  The sound quality is amazing, hooks up easily to any phone with Bluetooth capability.  I have used it by my pool, at the beach in a hotel room, driveway party, tailgate and just about anywhere you need to listen to music.  The strap is sturdy enough to hang from a tent or chair. It stands up, it lays down. It’s even waterproof. It fell in the sand at the beach and I washed it off, shook it out and it was good to go.  Everyone needs one of these speakers!! I always travel with it.  The charger cord can hook up to any USB port. So convenient.  You don’t even need a wall plug.  This would make a great college dorm gift or gift the person “who has everything”.  I don’t leave home without it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","So far, so good",5,"Been listening to it a bit here and there since it arrived a couple of days ago. My Avantree Cyclone was stolen so I found myself in the market for another small portable Bluetooth speaker. I liked the (decent enough) sound from the Cyclone and the basic cylindrical shape, and I kept these factors in mind whilst searching for a replacement. After reading through many lists and reviews I settled on the Flip 4. Although I haven’t much previous experience with JBL products, this speaker seems to be good value for the money. Nice features, quality of sound and handy size. Everything arrived as advertised, super easy to set up and start using right away. For people bagging on this small speaker not having enough bass, I don’t know what their experiences or expectations are, but I think it has a good, balanced sound between bass, mids and highs. Perhaps those complaining need to make appropriate adjustments to their EQ’s for the music they’re listening to? This speaker cost over twice as much as my Cyclone, and I’m hoping it serves me as well in the foreseeable future. I can't speak to battery life just yet, haven't had a chance to give it a workout yet. Thanks for reading."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker - especially great if your friends have JBL speakers as well,5,"LOVE the JBL pairing feature. Great speaker that fits in a cup holder or in a bag in the cup pocket. I use it in the shower and as my regular go to portable speaker when I take them on trips/out. pairing with another JBL was super easy, just pushed the buttons on both at the same time and they connected to each other almost instantly. The volume while paired like that is a little weird though, if you turn down your volume on one speaker, any connected speakers will also turn down-but not as much. Weird but you kind of get used to it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",NOT WATERPROOF,3,"This little speaker has worked perfectly for the past 13 months with great sound quality. However, it accidentally fell into the pool last week and was submerged for no more than 40 seconds and now does not work. I let it dry out and tried recharging it but although it tries to connect via my phone when in range it cannot and the crazy thing is it is not on. I'm so disappointed. It wasn't cheap and now it's going to about $90 to replace."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Quality,5,Great sound and good quality. Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!!!!,5,"I bought this wonderful speaker thanks to hearing the sound from an older model my son bought for himself.  I absolutely love it!!I live in a townhouse with high ceilings.  This one little speaker sends my music throughout the house.  I am listening to it right now.  It is at the top of the stairs in our loft area, receiving music from my iPod which is about 20 feet away in my bedroom.  I hear the music throughout the house loud and clear and so wonderful!  I can do my chores and rock out with my 80s tunes!!Thank you JBL for making such a wonderful product!  I think it is the best yet smallest speaker system I have ever had.  It will play sound from my iPod and my phone and my computer.  I am very happy with it.I bought a case for it too.  Love it!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love!,5,"I love this speaker. Sound quality is awesome, connectivity is awesome. I got it as a Christmas gift and used it without being charged first and it lasted for at least four hours. Put it on the charger to fully charge, used it for an entire day and it’s still working. Lol, I kind of freaked out because the directions said to put it directly under running water; it’s waterproof, but it felt so wrong lol to put a perfectly good electronic under a running faucet lol."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works perfectly,5,"Works as expected - I’m happy with my purchase. I love the portability and sound quality! I take it all around (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, patio) as music is LIFE. I can’t wait to add a second one for the surround sound effect when watching tv or hosting small gatherings. Hang it anywhere (doorknob, bed post, cabinet handle) or simply sit it on a flat surface. **Like** if this was helpful!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lasted 2 years,3,"This speaker was amazing when we first got it. The first year was great. We use it on the boat and in the golf cart mainly. We have never gotten it wet and have always taken care of it. After the first year though, it started dying quicker which is expected I suppose. But now in the second year it wont even play a whole song without shutting off. Its frustrating and sad because I loved it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is not like advertised,3,The battery only stays charged for 4 hrs of listening to music not what the product says.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound at a modest price.,5,"You get a whole lotta sound from a small package with the Flip 4. Paired instantly and easily with iPhone and iPad. I experimented with different EQ settings on iPhone and found “small speakers” gave the best overall sound for the variety of music I generally play. Flip 4 handles bass, treble, and voice very well. The Flip 4 has volume and other controls that are easy to use but I tend to make those adjustments on the phone. It also can link multiple Flip 4 speakers to really fill the area with sound and now that I see and hear the quality I may get a second one to do just that. It seems very well made and durable but I haven’t tested the waterproofing and don’t really want to! Handles phone calls wit clarity. Battery life is supposed to be up to 12 hours, I haven’t pushed that but it has done 8-10 hr at medium volume without blinking. Like the easy to find bright orange charge cable. I read a number of independent reviews of portable Bluetooth speakers and the Flip 4 was always at the top of the rankings even though the price was middle of the pack. I am happy with This purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One of the best speakers on the market.,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is off the bat! Hits the bass well especially in closed up areas like under tables, between pillows, around soft surfaces etc. Overall it's great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,4,"Yes its a good speaker for the cost, the neighbors won't be calling the police for disturbing the peace..but for a small patio or kitchen, a medium sized room its kool, I like it ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Battery Life,5,"We use this for picnics and hanging out.  Sound is good with reasonably good bass in outdoors.  It's plenty loud for a group of 8-10 people talking and having a good time.  We typically have the volume at roughly 75% of max, and it will keep playing for more than 8 hours on a single charge at that volume.Generally no issues with bluetooth connectivity to an iPhone.  I did find that if I walked out of range (more than 30 feet), it would not reconnect until I shut the speaker off and restarted.No info on how waterproof this speaker is (fortunately).  I'm considering buying a second unit since a key feature is to interconnect multiple speakers wirelessly.  That would allow a little more stereo channel separation that you cant get on a 10"" device."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good little speaker,5,"This is the second one of these speakers I've owned. The first one I had seemed to hold a charge much longer, but I do love this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best decision ever,5,I love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound is not good - Won't connect to my daughter's phone,1,"Overall this is a good product but I wouldn't buy again. I bought two of these speakers because I liked the fact that I can connect more than one of them to my phone at the same time. And it always connects easily. The battery life seems okay but I don't use it often, so I'm not sure how the battery life would last if I used it all the time. The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the sound quality really sucks.  I have another bluetooth speaker and the sound is awesome. I know the problem is not because I got a defective speaker because both of them sound the same. Don't get me wrong. It's not completely muffled. It's just a comparison to my other speaker, which is very very clear. I wouldn't buy again.Update: I originally rated this a 3 but I am changing it to 1 star because it for some reason my daughter's iphone can't find it to connect. My daughter has an iphone 8. It's old but it should still be able to find the speaker. Her phone was literally sitting 2 inches away from the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surprisingly good sound!,4,"When the package arrived, I was disappointed because the speaker is totally smaller than I expected. But once I started using it, that feeling evaporated! It sounds great! Now that I can hear how well it handles bass, the size is honestly a benefit because it's more portable. I got the teal/turquoise color and it's hella cute. Also appreciate that it's waterproof and/or water resistant. I recommend this speaker for someone on a budget who wants nice sound but isn't ready to pay for a big boi speaker. Don't get me wrong, this speaker is kind of expensive compared to what my cheap ass has paid in the past. But for the price, if you're like me, it's really worth it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just get it,5,"This thing is awesome and the audio quality is insane, especially for how small it is. So glad we went with this one"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",love ?? Love ?? LOVE,5,"This Bluetooth speaker is amazing! LONG battery life, great sound, easy connectivity. I added a caribiner to the string it comes with, which makes it even easier to quickly hang wherever I am. Even my husband didn't bat an eye at the price after he heard it playing for a week or so.Two wishes- 1) the charging port is behind a super snug silicon flap... I have to fuss with it whenever I need to charge (of course this is the result of it being water resistant,) and 2) it would be nice to have ""next"" and ""previous"" buttons so the songs can be skipped or replayed from the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",dad is happy,5,"my dad had tried several cheap speakers, music sounded distorted, battery life was batery death, dificult to pair with bluetooth (my dad is almost 80, he textes memes and surfs youtube and takes pics with his cel though, clever oldman he is), so i convinced him of paying the extra cash for this one and it was good. hes happy, conectivity is great, sound is very nice, portable, anyways! great product!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality product,5,Awesome sound quality and it sinks to other speakers. Love this product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product!,5,"I have this mounted in a 1974 Ford Bronco with a 331 Stroker.  Short wheel based vehicle means short exhaust and loud!  It doesn’t drown out the vehicle noise, but I am able to hear the music.  I recommend it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing JBL Flip Speaker !!!,5,The quality of this JBL Flip Speaker is just amazing !!! I love it! My friend saw and heard it the other day and immediately ordered one from Amazon! Made so well !!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",price,5,buen sonido buen bajo
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery dies down very fast surprisingly,5,Great for on the go music enjoyment
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No Bass,3,I had a charge 4 for a few years before recently dropping and breaking it. I thought i’d try the Flip 4 because it sounded ok at a friends house. Got my own and I definitely miss the bass the charge 4 gives. Very noticeable difference. But if you don’t care about that then the flip4 will do.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just buy it,5,Perfect for what it is. Don’t waste time on others.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",damaged box and missing the charging cord.,2,I am providing a low rating due to the fact that the box was damaged appears to have been a return possible. NO charging cable. The box was damaged upon opening. Good thing my son had extra charging cord that fit this otherwise we would have returned it. I rated the battery life 1 start due to not having a charging cable. So far my son says it works well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for what I needed,5,"I use my speaker while on my treadmill, fits in my giant cup holders and connects to my phone readily. Also perfect to hang from the beam on my deck when grilling. I'm totally thrilled with it!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality but battery needs to go a bit longer,4,I used to own a JBL Flip before until the battery eventually died and it could only be powered while plugged in. Do NOT keep chargers in these plugged in and don't run the unit while plugged in or it will deteriorate and eventually kill the battery.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Red tube,5,Great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, but battery doesn’t last very long",4,"Love this speaker - the portability, sound quality, and durability in terms of being waterproof and outdoor use. I’ve used this speaker pretty regularly, a few times a week, in the 3 years I’ve had it. Over the past month, the battery has become almost completely unusable. It has to be plugged in at all times (so no longer portable or holding any charge), and even while plugged in the power supply is so poor it causes loud crackling sounds. Going to give the Flip 5 a go, but was hoping this would last longer than just a couple of years."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent speaker,5,"I own two of these - one for home and one for my classroom, and they have amazing sound and great connectivity and battery life, but what shocked me most was one day I was paddle boarding and a stranger who has the same speaker had it on their paddle board and they hadn’t secured it. It rolled into the water and floated and never stopped playing. I lunged for it and they were totally unconcerned and said, “Oh, don’t worry, that happens a lot.” ?? I was amazed!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!,5,Sound quality is amazing! Love taking it out to the pool and not having to worry about it getting wet.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound small battery,3,"Sounds fantastic for such a small speaker. However, battery only lasts about 5hrs of continuous play. This is considerably less than advertised and less than the cheap $30 speaker I’ve had for 5+ years. I’d buy it again though, but make sure I always had my Anker batterypack close by.Update: I returned the 1st one and reordered, thinking this one was just a fluke. The 2nd one sounds just as good but I’m only getting 4ish hours of playtime. I guess the “12 hours of continuous” playtime was a slight typo, eh JBL?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"I love the sound of this speaker, I often have to listen to music at about half volume because the sound is that loud. The only thing I can say that I don't like about this speaker is that it likes to have pairing games with a device that gets paired to another device besides itself. It will stop playing sound about a minute into playing. Then I will have to take it off and reset the device and repair it as a new device. So most of the time I keep it paired to only one device .. so it don't get jealous so to speak. Other times I will simply use the headphone jack, so that it won't shut itself off if idle. The sound quality is awesome though, so for that factor I can work with her a bit when she has her days. LOL"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice sound,4,good quality sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound at a reasonable price point.,4,"Very good sound quality. Love to watch documentaries featuring the old 60s and 70s rock bands and the Bluetooth picks up the signal from my smart TV. I am disappointed that I can't use the ton of songs I have saved on my computer. Evidently it is not compatible with Windows 10. I do get Pandora on my old iPhone so I use that so I can listen to music while doing yard work.  I was pleasantly surprised. Wish there was a way for them to connect via a Windows 10 computer, but on the whole am pleased with the purchase and use them every day."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Omg! The best speaker EVER!!,5,"There's nothing I  can say bad about this speaker! It's AMAZING!!!!I've bought other brands and the were ok, but nothing compared to this amazing speaker.The only thing I would change is the ""RED""Be more deeper in color. To me it seems more of a reddish - orange.Other than that  The sound quality is off the wall killer.  An amazing battery life and super fast change. Haven't tested if it's water proof like it clams. That's just me ??I do recommend this speaker for all who want the best sound for their favorite music! I give it 4????????????????GET IT!!! ????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL speaker,4,good sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery life seems good. It lasts long enough to not pay attention ...,5,"Battery: The battery life seems good. It lasts long enough to not pay attention to how long it lasts honestly.Sound: It is very good, very clear until 80% volume, then it gets a bit distorted. However, I never use it more than 60% volume anyways since it gets really loud. I think, if you need a product to play music in a very large and crowded party, just get a bigger speaker. For all the other use cases, this is just good enough. Another thing to mention is the bass is boosted, sometimes it fells like too much to me. But, I know some will love it this way.Waterproof: It is waterproof as advertised. Tried and passed the test.Size: It is not too big to carry around yet not to small to have bad sound quality. I think it is best if you want to go camping/backpacking etc. For home use, it is OK too (that's most of the time what I do), but you can go with less portable bigger devices too.Mic: Surprisingly, built-in mic is very good and can record every sound easily. Tried in phone conversations and worked better than what I expected."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Puts out LOUD and CLEAR sound for its size! BASS is great!,5,"The bass output is fantastic, for its small size. The JBL Flip 4 is hooked up to my Samsung Note 9+, and I use it for hands free calls via its Bluetooth. No issues with that. The Bluetooth pairing process is simple, and rapid. Its my understanding you can connect these with another JBL Flip 4, to increase the sound volume, or simulate stereo. I haven't had the chance to try that, though. It is a quality built item, if a bit pricey. Nit-picking; it came with an outrageously ugly orange USB cord. It would be a bit more classier if they mated the cord color to the color of the JBL Flip 4; mine is Black, and the code simply clashes with it.  It fits in my briefcase, unlike the much larger JBL Charge I once had.  Also it would be nice if JBL made a stand or cradle for it. It is the perfect compliment to any cell, or laptop. I would highly recommend it to any potential buyer. Its said to be water resistant; but like any electronics, I wouldn't want to test out that capability!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charger port bad,2,"I have had it for 5 months and it won't charge anymore,  you would think with it's price it would last a lot longer"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Think twice if you have an Iphone.,2,"The speaker sound and when paired with another Flip 4 is crazy awesome.Now the bad part..  The speakers were crackling and cutting out, they wouldn't stay paired with the JBL connect app.  Things just weren't right,  I'd start from the beginning time after time and things would work for a few minutes then start up again and again.JBL's customer service agents were trying to blame everything on improper set up.  And then a few went beyond that.  One said to ""Hit the phone button, and you need to let the battery run out and then charge it..""  Another said.."" It is the outlets in your house that cause interference with the speakers connectivity..""  I was like.. What the hell?So what I finally uncovered..  It is Apple's and JBL's products that don't match up well.  After sending a detailed email of the problems and what i was trying to do to systematically go through all I was told and what to do..  I got the most mindless idiotic response back from a JBL rep.  I was pissed,  I called JBL and pretty much ripped the next poor guy a new one.  He was actually the only guy who told me the truth.. He agreed it was the Iphones compatibility with JBL's speakers.  From the Bluetooth to the App.  Why doesn't anyone say that in any of the reviews, or warn you before you buy?  I at least got off the phone with him and was satisfied that I got the truth.  He said he was told by Apple that when he tried to get answers for the issues customers were having that he was told that by Apple.  I called Apple and was told the same thing.  Apple products and JBL's products are not meshing well at all.  A single speaker isn't really the issue, but I bought two and using them together is worthless for how bad the app and connection is.Who is going to fix the problem?  JBL? Apple?  No one?  So if you have issues and you are using an iphone, or I pad.. You are SOL and don't let the idiot customer service reps in Singapore BS you into thinking you are doing something wrong, or one of the other elaborate things they will try and tell you.  That isn't the case.As the JBL rep and the Apple rep agreed.  JBL was thinking Apple was going in a certain direction and they aren't.  If you have an Android phone.. You should be good. If you have an Iphone..  You are in for such a fun time until someone pulls their head out.Love the speakers, but JBL and Apple are selling a bunch of lies to their customers, letting them think they are getting a product that will work with their devices."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,4,"This is my second Flip 4. I was hoping to get them both to play in sync, in stereo, as advertised. I haven’t gotten that to work yet but I still like these speakers. Light, durable, with a pretty good sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great on our HobieCat,5,We really like the sound and the battery life. Super easy button control and lanyard to clip it to the boat. Very happy with the purchase!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love,5,Great little speaker!! We use it all the time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",SOUND GOOD TO ME!,5,"Put simply, this thing rocks! I have purchased multiple portable bluetooth speakers over the last few years and none compare in sound quality to this little gem. I initially purchased it to use outside when working on the lawn, sitting in the hot tub (since it’s waterproof) and taking up camping for some quiet background music while observing  the night sky. This speaker provides amazingly clear, beautiful sound that you can take anywhere. A buddy of mine recently purchased this same speaker after borrowing mine for a yard party and being overtly impressed with it’s ability to cover his large back yard and patio with background music.I listen to a wide variety of music and am generally pleased with the sound quality that this speaker provides. It is not the bass-booming speaker that you might get from a Bose unit but it holds its own with base tones and gives crisp, clear sound ... a quality I’ve found lacking in most of my previous bluetooth units. With it’s excellent portability, fantastic sound and reasonable price tag I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t own one of these.Enjoy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound & portability & durability, NO REWIND",4,"I really like the range of sound this JBL portable, water-resistant speaker offers.  Super easy to use, and pretty weatherproof as far as I can tell (haven't used it in massive rain).  My one complaint is that you can't rewind 15-30 seconds with the push of a button, you can only skip forward.  So great at an outdoor party when someone doesn't like the song playing, not so great when you're listening to podcasts and the speaker's intonation drops and you miss the last line of the point someone's making.  The point of the durability and limited controls on the speaker itself is so the device with the data on it can be tucked away in a safe place.  That means I need to pull that out from wherever it is safely stored to hit rewind on the streaming device instead of just hitting a button on the speaker.  Wish I had recognized this before I bought several to ""hook"" together around a large area.  So good sound, nice to look at, does what they say it will do.  Just no rewind."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A fine speaker for the price.,5,"With anything that has Bluetooth occasionally I will need to turn off the power button for a second then reconnect due to choppy sound, but this typically only occurs after having used the item for longer than two or three hours. The sound is fine, and if you are a person who listens to music in the shower it will survive sitting on the edge of the tub or even inside the shower just be sure to close the flap which covers the charging port tightly. I'm not sure how far the speaker reaches before losing connection, but the sound will begin to cut out around 20-30 feet from my experience with it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good bass and all around sound,4,Very good sound and bass also very good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",super solid product,5,"It might be a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I really love this speaker. it came really professionally packaged, with foam and a magnetic box. was super easy to connect to my phone. The speaker feels really solid in your hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. I have been using it for the past week and I only have charged it once. The battery life lasts very long if you remember to turn it off when not using it. The sound quality is really nice and loud, and fills out a room well. the bass is actually really good, and you can actually feel the bass at the top and bottoms of the speaker. shipping was easy and came quickly with no hassle. one thing is when it is standing upright since the bottoms aren't perfectly flat it tilts a little bit, but that just annoys me and doesn't detract from the product. I love the fact that it's waterproof so I can use it in the shower. Overall I am super satisfied and would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in a good quality durable speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound is just around the corner!,5,"I have been a JBL fan for many years and when I needed a new Bluetooth speaker this one was a no-brainer.  Easy to setup and use with my android phone, iMac, and Chromebook.  The sound is superb as expected and the battery life is wonderful.  Best buy for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes????,5,"I absolutely love this speaker, everything about it??  I was buying them from Big Lots because they were cheap but they would quit charging because the charger ports were so delicate.  After buying a bunch of them, I finally realized I could have already bought one nice & more expensive one for how many I had already gone through.  So. Bought this one & m so glad I did, yes; it was more than worth it in every single way ?? wish I had just done this from the beginning ?? by thank Hod I finally did????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,Wasn’t able to connect to different phone other than mine.  Possibly phone issue not speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just Stellar,5,"There’s that old expression: “more bang for your buck” and that really applies to this JBL. I bought one after my old trusty Bose, took one too many spills and stopped connecting. I needed something that fit my budget and the JBL did just that - and more. Connecting was easy and the sound quality is out of this world good. A little rumble at max volume and bass, but nothing unusual. The sound quality is stellar - it’s almost like the JBL I knew from the 80’s is back. Battery life is amazing - even better than my old Bose. You will not be disappointed. I’m buying another and that doesn’t happen often."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Like old times,5,"I am a married, mother of three, who likes to “unwind” with a few neighbors and friends occasionally. Tonight, amid the Covid-19 outbreak, The hubby and I were cooking hot wings and  feeding a few people, when we had a noise compliant. The JBL speaker that we’ve owned for a few weeks has gained us a “NOISE” complaint. And for the record, my husband and I are the supervisors of the deputies who had to answer the callFor that noise complaint. So, with that said, I highly recommend this speaker because the last time We had a noise complaint  was when we had a live band!Woo!We have a three acre lot with 10 acres of green space behind us....and one little speaker on the back porch that was just a notch above the “half” mark on volume got us a noise complaint.  *****5 stars*****"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente!,5,JBL de lo mejor en sonido y speakers!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Checked all boxes,5,Checked all my boxes for a Bluetooth speaker. It  is in expensive range for me. I do not know if it worth it. But so far satisfied.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery drains quicker than I expected,4,I love the durability this speaker has and how easy it was to connect via Bluetooth but I am NOT impressed with how quickly the battery dies. I needed this for work 8-10 hr shifts. And in the online description it says 12hrs from fully charge. It also doesn't tell you how long to charge it right after unboxing. I had to look that up myself. I have had to put it on the charger at work every day since I have used it. It's really frustrating considering what I paid for this speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for however long the battery will hold up,4,"First things first this is a pretty great speaker, well built and loud rich sound. I use this mainly at work and I have no choice but to max out the volume and throttle the volume with my phone anywhere from 80% to max. This speaker can handle it with no problems. The downside to that is the battery life is about 1.5-2 hours tops in perfect working order. You could maybe get another 30 minutes with a charging cord but it can keep up with the draw. In a home setting or even outdoors you would probably never have to raise past half volume and the battery lasts hours upon hours. My problem currently is the battery and charging system. I may get 45 minutes tops plugged in before it cuts out to continue charging. Turn it back on it shows I have about half charge but cuts back off in minutes. I'm sure I killed the battery after a good year of cranking it to 11. Would still recommend this speaker to anyone looking for big sound in a small package for normal settings around the house and yard or on the move at a lake or park."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker - My new life companion,5,"The JBL Flip 4 has become my companion. Everytime I'm chilling at home, in every photoshoot I make, hanging out with friends; it's there playing my Spotify playlists. This was such a good investment.Quick tip: I'd you're a photographer, get you this speaker and take it with you to your photoshoots, your clients will love it, specially young ones. It makes the ambient less tense.The only thing I notice is that the battery life is just about 4h when on max volume. But if you keep it around 70% its way closer to the advertised 10h battery life, and at that volume it's pretty loud (the volume increase starts to taper as you get past 70, so no that much volume increase for the battery life you're sacrificing).Range is pretty good (using it with my S8), I can easily keep my phone in my bedroom and take the speakers to the bathroom while I shower.I've also noticed that the battery indicator is not very 'acurate', it goes quickly down to 3/5 dots then lasts long in those 3 dots, specially in the last one.Overall I'm pretty happy that I decided to purchase this one and not the off-brands bluetooth speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for the price,5,Item arrived quickly and well packaged.  Easily connects to my phone to play my music when I want  Great price and good quality but think I will be looking at other more versatile items with bigger sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",If you want to listen to music other AM dial this is for you.,2,It sounds like you're listening to AM radio bass is not there and trying to reprogram my phone's equalizer it sound a little better but this  jbl flip 4 sounds terrible.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,"I’m very glad I purchased speaker. I recieved this speaker as described. You can read the specs, and see that it’s waterproof and all that good stuff, (although I don’t plan on bringing it anywhere near the water). The Flip4 has amazing sound quality and great bass. You certainly get your money’s worth with this speaker. Normally worth around $110, I was lucky enough to get it for $79.95. It’s extremely easy to pair with your device, right out of the box. From opening the box to playing music from YouTube and pandora took only seconds. And the battery life lives up to its reputation. To put it in perspective, back in the 80’s and 90’s, you’d have to buy a huge, bulky stereo system to get a great sound like this. We’re living in a time where we get can get something this small and portable that delivers huge sound, so take advantage of it. Great for parties, or if you just use it for relaxation or working out. You’d obviously get an even bigger sound if you pair it with one or more other Flip4’s, (which I have not done yet, but plan on it)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker in its class hands down!,5,This speaker is elite. I bought the “charge 4” first because of1. The sale at Best Buy for one2. The sound quality that came out of this mid size speaker compared to the others they had displayed.I then learned about JBL link and figured I’d get a smaller version for work considering how happy I was with the charge.I DO NOT REGRET IT A BIT! The highs and mids are crisp and clean. It obviously doesn’t have as much bass as the charge but when paired they’re the dynamic duo.I was reluctant to have a buddy who has the Xtreme 2. Ohhhhh my gawddddd. Needless to say party was lit!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super cute,5,Very unique and compact I love the waterproof feature and the sound quality is perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!,5,I just got this a few days ago but it is way better than the previous speaker I was using. I haven’t tested the battery life yet but it’s louder and easier to connect to compared to my previous speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Distortion Above Medium Volume,3,"Sounds great at lower volume but as I started to increase my phones volume, at about the 3/4 marks I start hearing bass distortion.  I thought ""certainly not with a JBL"" so I double, triple checked and sure enough.  really sounds bad at higher levels.  My cheaper version (Rockville) sound much better at higher volume levels.  Surprising.  Not sure if I will keep it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, easy set up and long lasting battery",5,"This was a father's day gift for my husband.  He uses it mostly for work as he is a package delivery driver and his truck does not have a radio so, it is bluetoothed to his phone's music and the battery lasts for 12 hours.  We have also used it when we are in the pool (it's waterproof) and the sound quality it really great!  I also thought the price of this is really good and you can link more than one of them together which will be great for around the pool."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice,5,The JBL speaker we have sounds very nice.  The only problem I have is I got the wrong size.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Everywhere You Go!,5,"For what it's worth, I'm a musician and lover of quality audio. But I might be really bad at both, so take this with a grain of salt.I need tunes everywhere I go. In the garage, bathroom, funerals, etc. Some friends have JBL bluetooth speakers, and the sound really impressed me. So I bought the Flip 4 and I couldn't be happier! The sound is clear, big, and full. I have a macbook pro, and when I pair the two (with a quality chardonnay) it makes watching videos/movies a giggling joy!My only ""con"" is... sometimes it takes a few tries to pair. It'll fail the first few times, but eventually they lock together in a lover's embrace and off we go!Beautiful speaker. Would buy again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Sound quality is fantastic.  One of best purchases
"JBL Flip 4, Black",As described!,5,Watch movies on my laptop and I camp very often. It’s a party in a speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Mid range for clear music,5,"Not bass heavy until you pump it up and you really don't want to pump it too loud but the quality and clarity is outstanding in comparison to the others I've tested at the same time. the build quality is the best... I don't know why they keep changing it... I guess we are the big babies who find it difficult to stick with one thing... so ok... new new new!!!.. that was just a rant because I like the build and battery and sound quality, why couldn't they just enhance the electronics inside?But would recommend this!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Works great, easy to set up..",5,Took it away with me to the park and on vacation. love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT SOUND AT A GREAT PRICE,5,"Having through the years bought several of the bluetooth speakers from the well known upscale brand and paying hundreds of dollars for them, I was amazed at the quality of the sound for these JBL speakers, nice small size, carry it to work, carry it to the yard or garden or listen around the house. The quality of the sound is exceptionally nice for the price. I was so impressed  I bought this one for my wife, and another for myself. They are a great value and sound great. The battery lasts about 8 hours for me, playing loud polka and Christian music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",BETTER THEN I EXPECTED,5,"Wow this little speaker give out high quality sound and base for its size love it. Had it with me on my Cancun trip on the beach can hear it over the crowd , and waves from the ocean."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Like it,5,It was good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doesn't last even 4 hrs,4,"Everything is great, besides the battery life"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",After a Year it dies,2,"Ive bought this one twice, and the thing I've noticed is consistent after a year it begins to crumble. the battery life gets strange, and the connectivity not great. Right around the year mark. Its still useable, but you lose the comforts of what you had during the first year. the ability to be able to run around, charge, and go about as freely. something to be aware of when buying one of these. I'm going to give myself an upgrade and see how we go this time around. with love, J"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stupendous! 3rd flip ive owned. Great quality,5,Fantastic
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Love it, but unfortunately I was disappointed after receiving the second speaker.",5,"I recently bought a Flip 4 and I love it. I love it so much so that I purchased a second speaker given how heavily JBL advertises the ability to connect more than one together.Unfortunately, I was disappointed after receiving the second speaker.1. While you can connect them, it doesn’t always work first try to the point of needing to turn it off and back on again to connect it.2. There is significant latency with music between the media device and Flip 4 once the two speakers are connected.3.  Video sound is delayed by about a second when two Flips are connected, which makes videos unwatchable when using two speakers.4. When one song ends and another starts sometimes one speaker will disconnect and take up to 15 seconds to reconnect.5. When two speakers are connected not all sound from the media device is sent.. some programs only work when a single speaker is connected.6. When a speaker disconnects it often makes popping sounds when reconnecting because it has not acquired a solid Bluetooth signal.For all these reasons I am returning the 2nd speaker I purchased and sticking with just one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would recommend,5,This little gadget works well. The sound quality is great for what I use it for which is in the office listening to classical music to small get togethers. Bluetooth connectivity is easy and the battery life is real good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, it is clear and has great bass.",5,I have been looking for a nice device to play music when I go camping with my family. This was a great buy and the sound is great!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This thing is great!,5,"I used to have the JBL clip until I lost it on the golf course so I got this to replace it, this thing is at least twice as loud as the clip!! It’s so much more clear and seriously so loud, and still perfect for the golf course/house/literally anything. Super impressed and anyone debating if they should spend the extra money on the Flip, you 100% should."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice little  speaker,5,Great little speaker for the money. Especially when you can take calls through it. Definitely recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Naisu!!!,5,"I bought this speaker cause I had a couple friends who owed these and i was really pleased with my time borrowing them. Mind you my friend's speakers where very beat up and were sort of mistreated, my friend dropped his a lot. So it is also very durable, the sounds are just as I remember them and better, the sound is so crisp and clean, the beats sound ORGASMIC and the battery life is great. I'm just gonna say that if you're looking for a GOOD speaker, this is the way to go. Or you could buy a newer one like a FLIP 5."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not a bad speaker. Charger is trash.,4,"I expected more from this speaker. It has great sound as it is a step up from the JBL Flip 3. I had originally purchased the flip 3 and fell in love with it as soon as I began using it. The sound was a bit distorted when listening to certain songs on maximum volume. But after using it for only two days the distortion got worse with one song being particularly choppy and extremely distorted almost as if the sound was coming from a radio dispatch or a walkie talkie. I ended up returning it and upgrading to the Flip 4, which did live up to its expectations of having better sound. I haven't fully had the chance to test that out the battery life yet but I will give an update once that has happened. But one thing I am frustrated with is that I have only had the Flip 4 for about a week now and I just charged it once and the charger came apart! One use! For something so expensive I would have expected Better quality in the charger. The only reason I am not too upset is because I already have an extra android charger. That is out of luck. This should be fixed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente producto,4,Como lo especifican llego a tiempo
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud and Full,5,"I love it!  I paired it to my Android pad before I knew what was going on.  Easy!It has rich full sound.. I was playing music from YouTube on it and it was great.  I also played talk shows from iHeart Radio and SiriusXM.  My pad isn't always loud enough to hear over background noise.  With the Flip 4, I can turn it up and hear everything.  Also, with Sirius and iHeart, I can pause it if I need to interrupt my listening pleasure.  Can't do that with YouTube though.There is a jack so you can plug in your iPod or phone and listen to those, too.I carried it all over my house and out into my RV in the back yard.  I never lost reception.I don't know why you wouldn't love it.  I've only had it three days and I don't know how long the battery really lasts, but so far, I haven't been able to run down it.  I might buy another and blast both ends of my house and RV."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best BT JBL Stereo Speaker!!,5,"This is slightly bigger than the Flip 3 (which I just returned due to a loose screw or something inside). I decided to upgrade for about $7 to the Flip 4. Love the sound of the Flip 4 (and Flip 3), the battery is a bit better than the Flip 3 and I am glad it is fully waterproof where the Flip 3 was splash proof.Solved Added a Star - Latest Firmware Update resolved the noisy on and off sounds that we have been complaining about for more than a few years. Worth mentioning is that if you play this bad boy at a high vol. level the battery power does drop accordingly. As much as 60% (to ~4 hrs) at Hi Vol. You can play it plugged in tho so a portable bat. or outlet helps.So buy this if you're looking for a quality sounding, reasonably priced, portable, BT Speaker to get that great Harmon JBL Stereo sound. Note Flip 4 has Dual Stereo drivers which the FLIP 5 does not have (1 Flip5 = mono only) for $30 bucks more."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4,5,Love this bluetooth speaker. Sound is great.  Bass could be more pronounced.  Volume is great.  Good  sound clarity.  Great value .  Love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely Love it ??,5,"I just love the flip 4, the sound is awesome,  feels like very good quality,  this is one of the best purchases i have made on Amazon,  i read some bad reviews, i find some of the bad ones hard to believe,  only thing i would improve would be tne instructions,  had to watch a couple YouTube videos to get the hang of this wonderful speaker.  Also thought the protection plan was extended warranty for the speaker,  actually for tech support that i may need in the future. I will update if i encounter any problems."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,It sounds really good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life not as advertised.,2,"Used this speaker for about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. Bought it for use at work. After first use (a little over 3 hrs) I saw that the red LED was blinking. Low battery. I thought it was odd since they advertise a 12 hour battery life. But figured, maybe I didn't charge it all the way. Decided to do some tests.Recharged it (5 steady white LEDs that then turn off when complete). Tests were using Bluetooth connection within 10 feet.At 75% volume playing mostly rock music, it died after 3 hours and 40 minutes.Tested again next day.At 75% volume playing a mix of different genres of music, it died after 3 hour 57 minutes.Hmm... Ok, I get that the 12 hours is ideal run time, maybe calculated at 50% volume. But I think that it should have been able to approach 6 hours of time in my test.Sent an email to Haman/JBL customer service on Monday. They claim to get back to you in one business day. By Wednesday evening I hadn't gotten a reply. Sent another email Wednesday evening with the ticket number from the first email. By Friday evening I decided to return the speaker, with no response from Harman/JBL. Sent the speaker back on Saturday morning. Finally got a response from Harman/JBL Sat. afternoon but, obviously, it was too late.  I will pass on what they suggested to me in case it can help one of you.[""Thanks for contacting JBL Customer Support.I'm also sorry for the delay in response and I see that your Flip 4's batter only last for 4 hours. If you may, before you consider for a replacement, just to ask, have you tried charging the speaker overnight to see if that will put in more power to it and have it stay for even at least 10-11 hours of play time.If you had done this and still has the same issue with the speaker, you may check with Amazon for their option however, if they refer you back to us, we will surely honor our manufacturer's warranty. We will just need a copy of your receipt and your phone number. ""]If it is a Lithium Ion battery, I doubt leaving it charging overnight will ""put more power to it"", as they need some type of smart like charging circuitry that will cut off charging to prevent damage. But I could be wrong if someone here wants to try it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great ??,5,Great and awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Connects easily and has great sound quality, my kids like the strap on it so they can carry it around while they play and dance to music"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",neighbors are gonna hate this speaker,5,"Excellent sound! This speaker Rocks.. Well worth the money if you want to jam-out.Awesome battery life, as long as it’s not too loud, but you can charge and play at the same time which helps..Bluetooth hooked up within seconds of opening the box"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One speaker is awesome. Two? A little tricky but it works!,4,"I have had one of these for a few months and absolutely love it! So why two stars? Because I decided to get a second and do the stereo thing. The app is effectively useless and confusing. I can not get both speakers to show up in the app. It sees on or the other but not both. Five calls to support resulted in a lot of wasted time and no solution. The first call had me listening to some bonehead telling me I had to have three speakers in order to do stereo! Finally, on the fifth call, I managed to get the problem escalated. No solution yet.Update: I called the company a few times and, on the last call, I finally figured how to do the stereo thing.Stereo Pairing – Only pair one speaker to the player.Turning On – Turn both speakers on. Press Connect+ button on both speakers. Start JBL Connect app and wait for both speakers to appear and register battery level. Tap Stereo button.Changing my rating to four stars. Not five because this process needs to be more clearly defined in the manual."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Really good sound, long battery charge, very very pleased. Buy this!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Simply amazing little speaker.,5,"I purchased mine Saturday night and had it in hand Monday morning, (I kind of cheated. I work for the USPS, so I was able to intercept mine before it went out for delivery) so huge props for rapid shipping. As I mentioned, I work for the USPS as a mail carrier, and I wanted a decent speaker to listen to music and audiobooks while delivering my route. Mail trucks are not at all quiet inside. Road noise is horrible and the bumps and bangs of the suspension are quite loud. The engines engines typically sound like someone dumped a box of ball bearings into an old blender. All in all, not a very listener-friendly environment. Regardless, this relatively small speaker (roughly the size of a 16-18 ounce soda can) powers through the ambient noise and is clear and loud. Very solid bass for such a small platform. I started my route of about 5.75 hours of road time, fully charged, and at the end of the day, it was at about 80% charge.I love this thing. It even fits in my drink holder in the truck."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great deal for a quality product.,5,"I bought this speaker as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. He had a bose speaker that turned out to be not so waterproof when he dropped it in the lake, and honestly the quality of this JBL flip 4 is just as good as his bose was. Especially for the price. I have the JBL charge 4, which is slightly larger than the flip 4, but the volume is just as loud. This speaker also offer a strap at one end to make carrying easier. Such a great deal overall!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great when it worked!,2,Purchased this to connect to my iPhone. Connected great- had great sound - and only worked for 1 day. The unit will power on and connect but no sound. Very dissatisfied with the life of this unit - pricey for such a short life!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Take this anywhere,5,I have this flip and a JBl charge. I love them both. The charge has a little more fullness to the sound but the flip weighs significantly less and is easier to pack. They are both amazingly sturdy and have great sound. Batter life is also great.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredibly impressive.,5,"This speaker is amazing!!! When I first saw the Flip 4, I never thought that it would deliver such a powerful, rich sound. I knew that it would be pretty good when I ordered it, but I never thought that it would be as good as it actually is. This speaker is most powerful with midrange and lower sounds. It delivers smooth, deep bass. The higher sounds can be a little tinny when at full volume, but normally having it at half or even 1/4 volume is plenty enough to be heard across multiple rooms. The waterproof aspect is a nice touch too, I haven't submerged it yet, but it has been through some steam, and can be used as a shower stereo. The charging port and auxiliary connection jack are sealed away nicely with a seemingly water-tight rubber flap (again, I have not yet submerged it, so I am not 100% sure on any of the water proofing features).  The Bluetooth is fairly average, but it connects quickly with my outdated android. Overall, this is a great speaker for an even better price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery life is not even 6 hours ??,3,The battery life is not even 6 hours ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,Good Bluetooth speaker but I like my older model Charge 3 more - it sounds better for me.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Audio - Durability/Bluetooth/Battery Lacking - BUY BOSE,3,"First of all, I have to admit that the audio of the speaker is fantastic. I love it. I took this speaker all over the world with me.After having this speaker for less than two years, I started seeing three major issues:FIRST - the battery started moving from full charge to dying on me in less than thirty minutes (not at highest volume). It's obvious the battery is faulty and could only support so many charges. For being a premium, expensive speaker, this is very unfortunate.SECOND - I have had bluetooth connection issues since I purchased. In short, the bluetooth would cut in and out randomly.THIRD - I started having some audio issues when the bass would hit in the speaker. it would give a very loud and high-feedback electronic thumping sound. That's been happening for about a month.In short, customer service was nice, but FAILED TO DELIVER any value for paying so much for a premium speaker. For this price, I would expect a more encompassing warranty. This is my third JBL bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, I cannot warranty purchasing another given JBL's failure to live up to reasonable warranty expectations. A 1 year expected shelf-life is absolute GARBAGE. Their offer for a 20% discount for the next purchase was ridiculous.I'll be buying Bose for the next one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth speaker,5,I use this in my garage when I’m working on my cars or machines.  Great sound and bass.  No complaints and beats my old speaker which needed charging all the time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Way better than bose.,5,"I had recently purchased a bose speaker, I only use it for my tablet in my office. The bose turned all the way up, and sounded horrible. So I spent the money to purchase this jbl, 1. The JBL is way better than the bose. I don't even have to turn it halfway up, compared to all the way up with bose. 2. I wish I would have bought the JBL the first time. 3. I am very satisfied with this JBL flip 4 speaker, it's looks, the quality, the sound, basically the whole 9 yards."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can't beat it!!!,5,Now this JBL is absolutely ????Small with a great sound that will make you feel you have a surround sound bar system. This is the truth and type of portable music ??should be. I am amazed at all levels. When I connected to my cellphone via Bluetooth and hit play. Bammmmm my ears were wow ?????????? I had a few speakers but this one especially now and the price is a great buy. That's my opinion with all due respect to all. Give it a try and see what I am speaking about. 5 ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Poor battery life,3,"Battery life is listed on the box as 12 hours. It barely lasts 6. I would have returned it but I waited longer than the 30 days to get my money back and order something different. In fairness, the only reference to a date I could find on the speaker, box or user's guide was 2017 and I bought it in 2022. Maybe it sat on Amazon shelves for 5 years and died."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really good quality sound & bass,5,"The sound quality is VERY impressive, I’m very satisfied only put 3/5 stars because I haven’t had it long enough to judge that."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"Bought this to use instead of our terrible bathroom fan Bluetooth speaker.  The sound quality and volume are much better than I expected.  Even with daily use, I've only had to charge it once in the 5 months we've had it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker. I would like a stable base!,5,This Bluetooth speaker is powerful. It can overpower a small room. The sound quality is very good. I had a slight design issue though. There is no definite way of placing the speaker to rest other than hanging it from the carry strap. There are no flat surfaces! You can’t stand it on its ends because they are not square to the body and that would cover up where the speakers are. The body is round so the speaker will roll around at will. I have an iHome Bluetooth speaker and this JBL forsake literally blows that one away.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good,5,good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is perfect for 8 hour work shift.,4,"Sounds good,  battery will last an eight hour shift with volume at about seventy percent."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You can't beat these JBL speakers for the money,5,"I had a JBL Charge4 and loved it, so when I needed another speaker I decided to try the Flip4.  It is slightly smaller but the sound is just as good and it connects easily to my phone and Alexa.  Before we found the JBL products, we bought a couple of Bose Color II speakers which are great, but this is much more versatile and transportable. It costs a little less than the Bose speakers too, and the sound is just as good if not better."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great bang for the bucks,5,This is an awesome little speaker. I ordered this because Im upgrading my Jeep stereo system. And I did not want to be without tunes while doing it. This speaker has wonderful sound. I love it. The bass sound is lacking. But it really sounds good. I can hear it good even driving down the freeway with my top off. Battery life is great. Bluetooth connects easy. I have not had it die on me yet. I was out for 8 hours one day and it worked the whole time. Highly recommend this speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Excellent battery life, pairs to same model speaker easily,compact,",5,"Excellent battery life,portable as a coffee mug,pair with same model speaker easilyCould use more bass but it is small.We have paired two flip 4's together and it fills a shop with sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best product out there for the money,5,The best product out there for the money. You wont be disappointed. I wanted something to use for my podcasts and music while I'm in my pool and this is perfect. Took it on the boat and had sound for 6+ hrs. I haven't tested the battery limits yet but it seems like it lasts for days on high volume. Its durable and the handle it comes with makes it easy to carry around. Teal color is really nice. I was going to get the Flip3 but for a few more dollars you get the ability to submerse it under water (just an insurance for me) and if you want to get another one you will be able to connect  them to amplify the sound. (Which I assume is especially helpful for siblings or best friends. I will eventually have a few around the house for when I'm deep cleaning different parts of the house and want seamless sound.) Note: this has the Connect + Plus feature and not the Connect feature as their earlier and other models. As of this time it can only connect to other Flip4s.  10/10 would recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,"Had this speaker for about 6 months, have accidentally submerged this it for a few minutes multiple times and it still works like new."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Expensive, but worthy investment",4,"The best speaker I have ever purchased. It is so expensive and I am not the kind of person to spend $80 on a speaker, but this is definitely worth your money. The bass is powerful. It’s great for listening to music but no so much for, for example, watching movies. It is somewhat difficult to understand what people are saying through this speaker, but that’s not a big deal to me. I have dropped it a few times, taken it to the beach, held it with wet hands, and it is in great condition. After almost a year of having it, it is a definite upgrade from the JBL 3. After almost a year of use with the JBL 3, it crackled and made a rhythmic thumping sound after I raised the volume past a certain point. Would recommend this investment!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Portable Speaker,5,"We love our JBL!  We purchased as it interfaces with our Peloton bike.  I really wanted the in studio feeling - (I like loud music when I work out) so it works perfectly for this!  It's also great as we can grab and go with it if we are taking a trip or out where we would like some music going.  My only feedback would be - it would be great for this model to also come with some sort of base or feet that can help it sit up nicely.  The ends are the bass so I hang it from the cord (not the charging cord) it came attached with from a hook near the bike!  But, I would prefer it to be sitting near us without having to stand it on end or it roll away."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great. Looks sleek. Easy set-up.,4,"I just received it yesterday and haven’t spent any length of time using it so I can’t comment on the battery life.  Also thought I could stand it on its side but that would block one of the speakers. Doesn’t matter, I can live with positioning it horizontally. This is replacing an old am/fm clock radio that was mounted under the kitchen cabinet. It looks much better, especially the color (white). And we don’t need another clock in the kitchen as there is one on the stove and one on the microwave."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for teens,4,Got this for my granddaughter for her 16th birthday. Christmas her 13 yo sister had to have one. Love that it is waterproof. Sound is excellent even when loud. ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this so much it’s worth it,5,"I love this so much, I might be a little expensive but it’s worth it. This product it’s water proof and when water falls on it there I no muffle at all sound is 10/10 and over all this is 100/1000000"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Little Speaker Iv Ever Had,5,Sounds better and is louder than the 3. Looks clean and well made. The sound is far improved to the last gen and other similar speakers. It’s one of the more expensive for a reason. The distance is great too. I have this strapped to my electric scooter and it’s able to overcome the wind noise. I take it to the beach throw it in the sand no worries. Did it mention it sounds amazing for a small speaker. Comparing it to others the treble and mids are so much more crisp then others. The vocals come thru clear and don’t hiss or sting or rattle. The bass is great for speaker of this size but to be honest my ear likes a rounded clear speaker more then a boomy low end heavy speaker most other millennials prefer. So if your a true audiophile then you will appreciate the rich and true highs and mids with a balanced low end. One of the better investments I have made.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Product came without the charger…,4,No charger…
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good base,5,small great base
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Simply amazing,5,"Great sound for camping, or driving around in a llv while delivering mail.  Lol"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",De verdad es muy buena,5,La marca y buen sonido
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is great!,5,"Great sound, gets loud, has bass, had a long battery life, and is water resistant!It listens to me better than my phone does. I have to yell so incredibly loud  and numerous times to get Siri’s attention when not connected to this speaker, and need only my inside voice to say “hey Siri” once when it’s connected to this speaker to activate Siri.One time I forgot to turn off the speaker when I left, made it around the corner to my car and still heard my speaker playing from my third floor apartment. Bravo!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Truly waterproof,5,Fantastic purchase if your like me and you accidentally close it up in the hot tub and it is submerged for 24hours..  and it powers right up and plays lol
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Definitely does not last 12hrs,2,"Bought this speaker to be able to use in my booth for music during fair season. The speaker says it should play for up to 12hrs if fully charged. We charged it fully and maybe got 4-5hrs out of it at best, it takes hours to recharge it for it to only last a few hours and to top it off it won't play if it's plugged into power. You would think that even if it's dead, by plugging it into direct power it would stay playing like any other speaker... nope! This thing is useless at best. I would have been better off getting a cheap plug in speaker to have all weekend, at least I would have had consistent music for my customers. Won't purchase again or recommend to anyone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,This speaker is very portable and does a great job with battery life and sound quality. I am very happy with it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Always lasts over an hour, even a year later, on full blast",5,"Plenty loud enough, and can hook up with an unlimited number of more of these, for a long daisy chain of simultaneous music.  The newer models don't have that feature.  When I'm on a hike with a group, a few of us stop for a snack event, and others will have the same one.  We can all listen to the same playlist at once.  If you want 4 times the loudness, get 4 of them, and you can spread them out.  Great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Easy set up, great quality.",5,"I had a JBL similar to this many years ago, it was okay. It was a bit tricky to set up and so I didn't use it all the it much. I don't even know where it is now, I may have given it to one of my daughters.Now, this new one, WOW! Easy to set up, good sound quality. Forget what they say about battery life, it lasts longer than advertised.I would definitely recommend this product. Great job JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it.,5,Great sound easy-to-use  would buy again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A solid bluetooth speaker that perfoms as advertised!,4,"I have, over the last year or more, purchased five (5) JBL Flip 4's.  Two reds, one blue, one triangle-pattern (forget the name), and one ""ocean blue"" (but promptly returned it when they shipped a standard blue).  I use these at work (production / factory floor) and it is impressive.  I love the water-proofing (mostly for the dust-proof aspect of it) as well as the durability and feel.  Connecting multiple Flip 4's to one another using the link button (near the power button) really opens up the audio experience!  They charge fast, have a good battery life (I work 12-hours+, typically and it holds up the entire day).  Even my oldest, first-ordered unit (red one), still keeps a great charge!  Impressive.I've had a couple of co-workers order some, as they always want to borrow mine (I only have 1 or 2 at work) and they were quite happy with theirs, too.  Overall, the JBL Flip 4 is a solid bluetooth speaker that performs as advertised."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ehhhh...,4,"I’m gonna be real. I’m an audio dude, this thing lacks bass big time. I love the mid and his but the lows are disappointing low key. How to know if a speaker sounds good? Play “circle of life” from lion king. That song is Eqed to absolute perfection. If its lacking something, you’ll know right away. And what you right away can tell is that it’s missing the fundamentals of the songs which is mainly the low end especially since it’s a very powerful song. I give it a 3 out of 5 just being real."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You'll Flip For the JBL Flip 4!! Great Sound!!,5,"After trying several wireless Bluetooth speakers, they just wouldn't work!! I was wasting my money with those pieces of junk!! One after the other!!!! That is until I decided to try the JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth Speaker. I was truly amazed at the sound coming from this speaker!! It sounds a lot better & it has true base to it!! I managed to get it pair with the smartphone. Now it sounds like & has great stereo sound.I'm so thrilled with this that now I'm contemplating getting one of the JBL Boombox Speakers!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality sound,5,Cost a little too much. Could be louder.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sounds quality & loud,5,Excellent sound quality and louder than other cheaper products/brands I've tried. I bought it to take out on our boat & we can still hear it when driving full throttle. It also connects quickly & easily via Bluetooth. I also like to grab this speaker when I'm going out back to watch my son play or when going out on our golf cart.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must buy,5,What is there not to like about this speaker.  Sound quality is outstanding. I have gotten it dirty and wet. I dont want to try surging it in water. Its lasted in my damp garage so I'll take that as being water proof.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great but Horrible Battery Life,4,"I love this speaker to take to the beach, pool, or anywhere outdoors. The sound quality is great and the volume gets pretty loud, but the battery life is horrible. It takes maybe 2-3 hours to fully charge and will be completely dead after about 4 hours. I have to charge this hours before I plan to use it and sometimes it dies within the first two hours. I really wish the battery lasted more than one use, it's super annoying trying to entertain with this speaker because it will likely die in the middle of it. Luckily I have a larger speaker that plugs into the wall, but I still use this for shorter duration outside."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Take this speaker with you anywhere!,5,WE use it when we take our RV out and also use it on the bridge of our boat. Great sound and long lasting battery!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A portable speaker!,4,"This is all you need in a portable speaker,  easy connection,  loud with good bass and long battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not a Good Investment,3,"After exactly 2 years, this speaker has failed. It served me well for awhile - I bought it for a trip to Europe when I wanted music on-the-go. Since then it has mostly lived on a kitchen shelf. It's portable, had nice sound and battery life. The white color was a mistake, I'll admit. It's now the color of a grungy bath towel that's been washed in hard water too many times. Whatever.But about 22 months after I bought it, it started to lose battery life. Now it'll barely last an hour before having to charge again.Even worse it has developed a crackle noise, as if the bass has ""blown"". Not a constant crackle, but every single time I go to use the speaker it eventually happens. Then the only way to make it stop is to turn it off for hours.  It's awful on the ears and SO frustrating when it happens. Of course I'm past the 1 year warranty.Overall - I would not buy this again. For the $90 I paid, I expected a good 4-5 years out of this speaker. Most of us can't afford to replace our investments in personal technology every 2 years.I've contacted JBL directly to see if they'll guide me through fixing it, somehow. We'll see."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4 jbl,4,It sounds good at lower volume but crackles at higher volume. Thought it would sound better.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super Happy,5,At the recommendation of a friend I purchased this.  The sound is unbelievable.  Battery lasts a very long time.  Bluetooth connects no problem.  Phone calls are even really clear.  Handy to carry around.  Use it camping a lot too.  I haven't tested its durability yet but it appears well made and my friend has thoroughly tested it with positive results.  I'm not sure if the 5 version is worth the cost difference.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome battery life but sound cuts off even when connected via cable.,3,"Got this mainly because I needed a speaker for my PC and this one was small and seemed good. Audio quality is pretty good (when it doesn't cutoff that is) and the battery life is also quite good, I use it daily for hours and honestly charge it once every 3 days or so.Initially connected it via Bluetooth and noticed the sound would sometimes cutoff, figured it was the Bluetooth connection so I decided to get a cable to connect it directly to my PC. The sound still cutsoff, I have no clue why. Bluetooth is off, I am 100% certain it's connected via the audio jack so I have no clue why the audio just randomly cuts off sometimes.I'd say don't buy it since it's primary purpose is to listen to music and well, the music will be cutting off so it's not worth it. I still use it since I already spent the money but wish I had spent it in something else."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",HOLY CRAP! This thing is amazing!,5,"I bought the teal one because I didn't want to have another black speaker in my house, and it's much easier to find! The sound quality is BONKERS! It's so clean and clear (my test song is ""Hey Mami"" by Sylvan Esso because it's got great bass and fun highs). The battery life is really crazy. I took it on a 1 week road trip, and used it for about 10 - 12 total hours. Never recharged it. But the cool thing is it shows you the battery life (in white circles) when you turn it on. Speaking of turning it on, I love the sound it makes turning on and off, like a fun guitar noise. It's DEFINITELY water-proof. I took it in a pool, and used it in the shower (hung it from the shower head). It's fantastic. I LOVE IT. The fact that you can daisy chain a bunch, and that you can connect multiple devices at once makes it the best. Seriously one of my best purchases of 2018!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great beach companion,5,"Didn't take long after reading reviews to buy this speaker .It's perfect. We take it to the beach, and kayaking."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Connectivity goes in and out.,5,Bought as a deal of the day and After 4 months the connectivity starts to crap out.Funny just out of warranty. Can you imaging that?Started happening in June but I haven’t used the unit that much at all. Never got wet or abused. Sits on a shelf and gets turned on and off. All my other Bluetooth speakers work fine with my phone including studio monitors…..So tired of the crap we are sold……..BUYER BEWARE……Would not recommend to a friend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Needed a bluethooth speaker by the pool!,5,"I was looking for a portable, Bluetooth, water resistant or waterproof speaker for out on the deck and by the pool.  As I have seen others write, I was overwhelmed by the selection there was.  I finally settled on this JBL speaker and although I have only had it 1 day, I LOVE it.  I am NOT a speaker or sound expert, but to me It sounds great and was easy to set up. Also, it was easy to pair with my audio devices (particularly my echo dot that I will use out on the deck with it in the summer).  I wish I had known I was going to like it this much... I would have bought 2 at the special Christmas shopping price to be able to do the stereo mode or even the party mode (to include the yard).  Maybe they will put it on sale again before Christmas!  At t his point, I am very pleased with selecting this item."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,4,Use this on my boat all the time! Great sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Such a great speaker.,5,"Used this for quite some time now and the battery life is still amazing to this day. Great sound quality and super portable, I bring it with me everywhere. The bass is very impressive for its size. Well worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy bueno,5,Mucho
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Durable Reliable Portable Sound Beast!,5,"This speaker is really amazing ! Considering it's size it sure can light up a room ! It sounds much better indoors that  outside, but even outside it still manages to sound amazing. The bass on the speaker is so great, and it is to leveled out and clean, nothing sounds overpowered, its all perfectly even from the hi's to the low's. If you buy this speaker you definitely won't regret it. I've dropped this speaker so many times it's been wet and tossed around but it still is amazing quality. The only problem is that, I've dropped it over 30 times and one time I dropped it from at least 10 feet and the battery life while paired with JBL connect+ drains really fast, and whenever I play it full volume the battery dies fast, but when I first bought it , it lasted at least 5 hours full volume and like 12hours on halfish volume. I don't regret buying this product and I look forward to seeing a JBL FLiP 5!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"Dislike nothing, like big speaker sound, long battery life, light weight, looks good!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,4,Nice! Use for home desk. Sound is nice. Easy Bluetooth connection. Only dislike-the aux/charge cord is short.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great,5,Works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black","The highs aren’t quite high enough, but everything else is fine.",5,"The highs aren’t quite high enough, but everything else is fine."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Speaker!,5,"It took a few tries to get it right when it came to purchasing a Bluetooth Speaker and this one is satisfactory! I love the sound quality (everything comes through clearly), volume controls are positioned perfectly, and connecting it to your device of choose is easy! Another great feature is with some apps (on the Amazon fire stick) you are able to play and pause your favorite shows or movies at the touch of a button. This is a purchase I am extremely happy with!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good speaker,5,quality and battery and sound are all awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good clear sound,5,"This is the 7th one of this type of speakers our family has owned...yeah don't ask. Its the second JBL, the original model very similar to this cylinder I bought at Verizon on a whim 4 years ago for about $200. This was a fantastic speaker that my son snuck off to college with him...leaving me the cheaper  Costco and box versions.Its no surprise these little speakers have put the big ole speakers on the back shelf. This JBL Flip 4 is crystal clear. I can imagine some of the gut busting bass crowd complaining it doesn't stir your meal from lunch...the kind of bass that drowns out the music. To my ear, It has plenty of bass for 70s,80s, 90s rock and classical music....and more importantly....a good clear sound.Then the fact you can pair these with other JBL speakers.....does anyone want to buy very high quality some 4 foot tall studio monitors? How bout I trade you for a couple more of these? Kudos to the JBL guys!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Sound,4,"This is an awesome speaker. It has rich sound overall. The bass is quite impressive. Both my wife and I loved it.5/16/19 Update:We loved until it stopped working, that is. More precisely, it stopped charging. We have barely had it a year. There is a one-year warranty on it, but I am unsure of shipping costs. Nothing should stop charging in less than a year. It is not as if this was a cheap speaker. JBL makes (made?) good products. The fact that it stops working in so short a period of time is a MAJOR FLAW.9/14/19 Update:Well, the charging port on the Flip 4 broke again. Be very careful when inserting and removing the micro-USB cable as the port is delicate. JBL's (Harman to be more specific) support is awesome. They are replacing it even though it is a little bit out of warranty as a courtesy. Shipping is on them. So, if yours breaks within a year, definitely contact support. They will take care of it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works great,4,The sound is great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The one and only,5,"I had the Flip 3 before this (lost it, didn’t break) and I don’t think I’ll ever buy another speaker. I would consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, and for the price this is about as good as it gets. Size & shape is convenient and portable, a little skeptical to  test the waterproof ability but the USB cover seems secure enough considering how difficult it is to open. And the link feature is awesome if you have friends with a jbl speaker too"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great!,5,This speaker has a really good sound quality as well as an easy connection to any Bluetooth device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery life is a disappointment,3,If I'm not mistaken the battery life was advertised last up to 7 hours unless I got a hold of a lemon mine only last 3 hours.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Easy and seamless connect
"JBL Flip 4, Black",See JBL website for known unfixable issue,3,"Bought two. The sound is good and they were easy to pair. But please read the JBL support site about this speaker. There is a known issue of power cycling. So you turn it off and it turns itself back on and makes an audible noise to let you know it has done so. This is what is killing people’s battery life. The JBL site does a great job of explaining how to reset the speaker to factory settings. However, we have done it four times and nothing has changed. So you can’t keep the speaker charged and it makes a loud sound periodically and constantly. We bought it for camping but it wakes us up ten times through the night. Can’t keep it in our house either, it’s that loud. Can’t trust the battery life. Of the two speakers we purchased, this is occurring with one. So I guess you have a 50-50 chance as to whether you get a great speaker or a devil speaker. Good luck."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Water Proofing is amazing,5,I work in a kitchen and I bought this speaker to play music while I work causing it to often get dirty... I can literally spray the speaker off at the end of the night when I'm off and then shake it off and all the water comes right out of any crevice it seeped into
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super Easy and Great Sounding,5,"Ordered one speaker to use around pool while streaming from a device.  It was super easy to set up and the connectivity was great.  After the first day, decided to order a second one to create more of a stereo sound.  Have used for 4-5 hours at a time without any power loss or connectivity issues.  Had device inside the house, with speakers outside.  Easy to recharge and fast.  I would highly recommend these JBL speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Could be louder,5,"I love these speakers. Bought many over the years. So good, people keep taking them"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product just short battery life,4,This is an amazing product to use! It has great sound quality and it’s affordable but I will say that the battery life on it isn’t the best would and it lasts about four hours
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!!!,5,"I love my JBL FLIP 4! I got mine in red! It doesn’t come in carrying case though, but since I caught at a special I was able to find a perfectly matched red hermit travel case for it! I take my Flip4 everywhere- even to the bathroom to listen to music while I shower! It does take a while to charge but it’s worth it.My son even commented on what a good speaker it is! I recommend it and rate it 5 stars!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,I was amazed at this thing! We took it camping and played it outside off my Panadora app all day long and it never ran out of charge. I have another bluetooth speaker but the sound from this is like sitting in my home listening to my stereo. Fantastic sound with good bass response. My only nitpick is with the camouflage the controls are a little hard to see as they used black controls. On this color something with a little contrast would be appreciated.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Go for the 5,3,My husband went to Walmart and our heard the flip 5 for 10 dollars more.  They can't be synced together.  I would have paid 10 dollars more for the newer one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality sound at a attractive price,4,"This speaker is quite impressive for the price.  It will deliver a crisp sound at about 3/4 volume and has a little distortion at max volume.  The size, quality, construction are all spot on.  Only complaint is that it cuts out over Bluetooth on occasion.  I only knocked off one star because we've only had it occur a few times but it's annoying when it does.  Rebooted phones, etc. and the issue did not go away.  (This is NOT an issue every time we use it, only a few times)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Flip Ever,5,The sound quality of this speaker is amazing. It has a lot of bass and even thumps. The battery life is great. I can use it a few hours at a time over several days before recharging. I had an original Flip that I liked but this a huge technology advancement with the 4!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm very happy with it,4,"I haven't had the Flip 4 for long, so I can't comment on reliability and durability, but as far as sound quality in a small speaker, I'm very happy with it.  Yeah, it's still has a ""small speaker"" sound, but it's the best small speaker that I've owned so far.  You just aren't going to get big speaker lows in a speaker this size.  Those tiny drivers just can't push that much air.  Still it does a respectable job.  It's seems very well constructed and if it is water resistant as advertised, it's a great value.  I am using it mostly with my Echo Dot's so far and i like it's portability.  I just tell Alexa what music I want to hear and if I move to another room, I take the speaker with me...within range of course...and the range hasn't disappointed so far. I would definitely recommend.  The only problem is that now,  I want to try all the JBL bluetooth speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice,5,We love this by the pool or on our camping trips!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",How have I lived this long without it?,5,"This little speaker is a powerhouse. My neighbor was the one who'd mentioned it to me back in early summer of 2019. So, I bought it and am I ever thrilled. It sits in my bike basket or fits nicely in my water bottle holder frame when I am out on the trails. And trust me, people hear me coming long before they even see me at times. And what smiles it brings. I have brought it into the shower or bath. So soothing. Hang it from a cabinet knob in my kitchen for some cooking or cleaning music. Sits out on the deck while I groom my pooch to sounds from my Amazon music app. Goes out to the garden with me, too.  Give it a try. Guaranteed you will love having it around."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",ok,3,it ok
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,It's a great item with excellent sound and the battery life is great.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressed,5,"Nice little thing spits out my jams really nice and clear and sounds clear great bass on it I love it. The only thing I do not like is it I walk out of my office with my phone and come back later it will not reconnect to my phone and I have to go to setting and BT and click it to connect again. That’s why I gave it 3 stars on connection above.Other than that this is a great speaker, get one!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best performing small size speaker,5,"What a great speaker!!  I've been a DJ for over 20 years and I know good sound.  Now keep in mind, Bluetooth can’t hack higher quality audio as well as wired.  So if you are listening to this speaker via Bluetooth it's going to be a lower quality sound (not the fault of the speaker).  That being said, this speaker can push the base and hit the highs better than any other speaker at this compact size.  I originally bought this for my office, but the volume is just not low enough for that environment.  I had to get a cheaper speaker.  Now I carry this one around with me on the disc golf course, garage or just working around the house.  The battery life is excellent as long as you're not playing it a peak volume.  But I can say I don't always listen to Meatloaf when I'm in the garage, but when I do so do my neighbors."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid speaker,5,"Nice speaker. Good sound quality,  connected easily. Feels like a sturdy, solid built speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker but not very “Smart”,3,"The speaker is great and has amazing sounds for the price, but its’s also kind of inconvenient. If you leave it on while it’s not playing anything, it won’t auto shut off to preserve the battery. I am used to my $40 speaker doing so, so because of that I often forget the speaker is on and the battery drains."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,"Excellent sound quality and volume, excellent battery life, study design. Fit nicely into a bicycle water bottle cage, which makes listening to music while I ride a lot safer than using earphones, which tend to block out all other sounds. Riding with the speaker is not unlike riding in a car with the radio on -- you can listen to your music, but still hear what's going on around you. Much safer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",2nd review of owning it a year.,5,I’m reviewing this a year later. I have loved this speaker up until this week. It won’t charge up at all. I’ve spoken to the company and they won’t stand by their product. It should last more than a year. This is a waterproof speaker and hasn’t even been use md for that. I use it for my work (salmon suite). Very disappointed in this product and the company.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bass is boomin',4,"Connects automatically to my phone, only if my Bluetooth is already on when the speaker is turned on.  The bass is boomin, at the expense of some of the mid and high frequencies.  Left the speaker in the rain and showered with it a few times and it still works like a charm.  Trying to use it with more than one Bluetooth device is a chore and the aux input doesn't take precedence over Bluetooth, a silly design flaw IMHO.  The battery didn't seem to last an entire 8-hour work day ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Such a great idea,5,This is what I’ve been looking for. I didn’t know it existed till I saw one at the pool this summer. You have an app on your phone for music but the sound quality is crap. Connect via Bluetooth and this thing has booming sound. Good bass. You can control the volume from your phone or from the speaker.If you have more than one you can connect them and have speakers scattered throughout your house.The only complaint is the battery life. It is reasonably good. But not great. It probably would last the life of a party. Several hours. Maybe I’m expecting too much.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Quality,5,"I love this speaker. Awesome quality sound for such a small speaker. JBL is a great brand and I can’t believe I snagged the speaker at a 1/2 price promotion. It was super easy to connect via Bluetooth. Listened to much for an hour or two and barely used any of the battery-it came with about 3/4 charge-I have not given it a full charge yet to see how long it will last. I will be trying that out soon, if it passes TSA guidelines!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality speaker,5,Love this speaker! It's a good size and sounds awesome! Perfect for on the river with my paddle board!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Better than expected
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Honest review of the speaker,5,I've been using this speaker for three months now and I gotta say this is the best possible speaker money can get you at this price range.  Whenever I'm out and I wanna play my music I can tell you for sure you will get annoyed looks towards your way.For a decent sized room it's rather loud in public for example let's say you're walking you can hear the music at full volume (I can't guarantee this due to the fact that I haven't tried that yet also how loud the music or whatever you're playing from the speaker depends on how loud the device that's connected to the speaker is.)Now about the life span of the speaker I don't know whether or not the speaker is connected by aux cord or Bluetooth however by Bluetooth at full volume from the device and speaker it will lasts you to four hours long which is great for the speakers size.That's all from me absolutely amazing speaker worth the wait as well as every penny.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","JBL's ""Party Mode"" does not work properly!",2,"I really, really wanted to like this product.  The idea of having the same music play in all rooms of my place has been appealing to me for a long time and the circumstance that the Flip 4 is waterproof made it even more attractive.The first impression was slightly negative, because the sound the Flip 4 makes upon startup is annoying.  I decided I could live with this, albeit only begrudgingly.The second impression was better, as the sound quality is acceptable for a device this size.  It cannot match the sound quality of my Bose Soundlink II, but the idea of having the same music everywhere, made this a compromise I was willing to accept.The third impression was great, since pairing the speakers into ""party mode"" was really easy and the experience of walking from the living room to the kitchen and having the same music playing in both places was glorious.  At this time I had made my peace with the -- still annoying -- startup sound and I was planning on buying the JBL Extreme 2 as soon as it came out (it was announced in January of this year and is supposed to be available later this month).  This would give me better sound in the living room (in direct comparison with the Bose the Flip 4 is just too wimpy) and I'd have two speakers for kitchen and bedroom.  Maybe, I figured, I would even buy another Flip 4 for the bathroom.Then, however, came the fourth impression.The fourth and final impression, unfortunately, was a deal-breaker: I had to find out that the ""party mode"" works only some of the time.  Party mode works in such a way, that one speaker, the ""primary speaker"", is connected to the iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth and the other speaker(s), the ""satellite speaker(s)"", form an independent network with this primary speaker.  I haven't been able to establish any rules or regularity but for approximately 20% of the listening time, my satellite speaker would be highly staticky and would even stop playing altogether for a second or two every three or four seconds.  This effect would come and go seemingly randomly and it made no difference which of the two speakers was configured as ""primary"" and which was the ""satellite"".  It also did not matter how far the satellite was from the primary speaker and the distance of the speakers to the iPad also did not matter.  This is, obviously, completely unacceptable and I am now returning the two Flip 4 speakers I purchased about a month ago.The two Flip 4 units are awaiting pickup through UPS and I have placed an order for a SONOS Play 1.  Obviously, this is a different concept (not Bluetooth but WiFi based) and I will have to see how easy it will be to play my kind of music in the way I want it to play.  If things work out the way I expect them to, then I may buy another Play 1 and probably a Play 5 to get me close to the setup I was describing above."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just works,5,"This is the most reliable thing I own. I take this thing everywhere (camping, parties, visiting family) and it has never failed me. I charge it ... infrequently, and I've never had it die on me, even after extended use.The connectivity is also amazing. I want every other bluetooth device to do whatever this one is doing. It just works, immediately. Never had any issues."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s great,5,"Speaker works great. Took it to the beach , sat on the beach , sat the speaker on top of the yeti and it blares country music so loud. I ended up growing a mullet sitting there in the sand. 2 bald eagles flew over, screeching, and dropped a woman right in front of me. It took 2 eagles because ya know , if she ain’t 380 she ain’t a lady. She landed right on my speaker but this thing holds up. She muffled the sound a little bit but as soon as 6 of us picked her up it sounded brand new. Also waterproof , I took it out in the ocean with me and a shark grabbed me from behind. I fought him off , speaker in hand about 3 meters deep and she still works like a charm. Highly recommend"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Well worth the money!,5,"These things have a pretty good kick to them, especially when paired together. Battery life is a bit low, so if you’re playing at the max volume, they’ll last around 3 hours or maybe a little longer... the waterproof nature of them is amazing and super convenient for bringing by water without worries. The pairing feature is a little buggy at times but still a very cool feature. When you pair them, one dies significantly faster than the other will so be prepared to have a charger ready for it.If you purchase this, it will only connect with other Connect+ enabled JBL devices. It will NOT connect with regular Connect devices. So some of the Connect+ devices include the Charge 4, Boombox, and Xtreme 2. The Charge 3, Xtreme original will not pair with this.No regrets with the purchase! Unbelievable sound from such a small unit. It’s a crisp quality sound too, does not sound “cheap.”"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely Amazing,4,"I will leave the technical stuff and basics to others because as Dozer said to Neo, “It’s major boring sh*t.”  What you really want to know is how it sounds. This little speaker produces the best midrange you will ever hear from a speaker anywhere near its size.  The highs are also very transparent but perhaps just a tad bit soft. Most folks would probably never notice the roll-off.  There is no deep bass here although mid bass is what I would describe as moderately well presented.  Let’s be honest. Do you really expect this little enclosure to produce earth shattering bass?  If you do, I have some prime real estate located in the Florida swamps I will sell you at a discount.  However, I promise you will be blown away by the midrange where much if not most commercially recorded music resides.  Clean, accurate and palpable.  Worth every penny."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's okay.,4,I feel the battery dies too quickly.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful Speaker,5,"This speaker is absolutely amazing, and definitely worth the price! I have been using this speaker ever since I received it in the mail. I was so impressed with the quality, the sound, and the bass. I bought the white speaker, and the only thing I have to say about it is that the color looks like more of a pure white when it is in the light and might look like more of an off-white/grey in regular light. The speaker came with a wrist strap which is really awesome, and also a charger. The packaging is very nice, and I am going to use that as a place to put my JBL when I finish using it. It is very easy to pair with a device, and if you choose to download the JBL Connect+ app it is also easy to pair with as well. The battery life is spectacular, so you don't really have to worry about charging it often. Overall, great speaker! I would recommend this to anyone!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic for the money,5,"Great quality at this price. Put it through the paces this weekend at the river. Got Wet, beat/thrown around and still sounds great. It is surprisingly loud for the size. Bass gets a little off if you have it at max volume. Overall very worth it. Easy to connect and durable. End cap speakers are kind of exposed so that might be a weak point at some point but for now is great"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",just a spell over a year and losing a charge,1,EDIT AS OF 10/20/2020 THE SPEAKER SHOWS 4 DOTS OF POWER YET WHEN I PLAY IT LASTS FOR ONE MINUTE AND IS KAPUT. IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS I WOULD. WILL USE FOR TARGET PRACTICE WON'T EVER BUY JBL AGAIN PURCHASED!purchased this speaker in April of 2019.  I upgraded from a 30 dollar blue tooth speaker my doss sound box which was 3 years old at the time wasn't holding a charge so i figured well maybe if i spend another 50 dollars i will get quality.  JBL.  Good name.  I've seen and heard their speakers before.  It is July of 2020 and the speaker is isn't holding a charge and dying often.  I am very vexed as I feel like i have not received my money's worth because I have a 30 dollar speaker which STILL WORKS 4 years later.  4 years later that one works that i paid 30 for. this one that i paid 80?  nope.  No dice.I used to be able to run it for 3-4 hours at a clip on full charge.  Now i don't even get that out of it i get maybe an hour if i am lucky and that isn't at full blast volume.Today for instance(7/1/2020) i had 3 bars left on the battery when i got to work.  I turned on the speaker already down to 2 charges and the speaker kept shutting down. I said it isn't dead yet so it should be fine.  I booted the speaker back up no more then about 30 seconds later the speaker does it to me again.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR WELL OVER a month now.  I am done.So pros?It sounds good when it works and pairing it with your smart phone  is easy and straightforwardI believe it is waterproof I never tested that notion though.Cons-Life.  Not 14 months and my 30 dollar 4 year old DOSS SOUNDBOX speaker is still going strong.do your research. Maybe i got a bad batch but this is ridiculous.EDIT 8/6/2020 THE 30 DOLLAR DOSS SOUND BOX I ORDERED 4 YEARS AGO IS STILL WORKING. THIS 75.00 dollar JBL paper weight still won't hold a charge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Volume and Sound Quality Unmatched!,5,"Bought for my stepdad for Father’s Day and he absolutely loves it! I was nervous about the sound quality at first because he wanted it so he could listen to music on his side-by-side, but it’s exceeded expectations! If you’re concerned about sound or volume, don’t hesitate to buy. It has the option to connect more than one speaker together if it’s not loud enough, but I don’t think you’ll have that problem. Very impressed!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!,5,This speaker is amazing. I debated on buying a cheaper “knock-off” one as I know there are many out there with great reviews. After much debate I pulled the trigger on this JBL and I couldn’t be more satisfied.I use this thing daily while working and take it frequently on kayak camping trips and to the pool. I’ve had to charge it twice since purchasing it about a month ago. Zero issues with sound or connectivity!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds amazing for its size,5,"This speaker really shines when it comes to sound quality and even loudness too. With loudness it compares to generic speakers about double its size its especially loud in closed room. It has very powerful bass being able to vibrate objects close to it. As for the sound quality it sounds very lifelike when it comes to voices and instruments, basically on par with HiFi audio. Overall totally worth it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Speaker Packs A Punch,5,"One of the best bluetooth speakers that I've ever heard. It's light weight but feels durable and high quality. The bluetooth range is great. i had my phone in my phone and walked in my garage, upstairs, and left the speaker outside and it was still playing. I was really shocked by that. If there are any cons, I have yet to notice it.the bass is superb as well. That's a big talking point for this speaker and it does not disappoint. The sound is really loud, that you would think you might get a noise complaint if sitting on your balcony.I'm very pleased with this speaker and it did not break the bank."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,It is just what I needed to Hear!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I recommend this speaker!,5,"Got this as a birthday gift for my dad since he’s always listening to music through his phone while he’s doing work around the house, and man oh man does this speaker sound good it’s surprising how loud and clear this speaker sounds for it’s size, I might have to buy another for myself. At first I was iffy because there’s other cheaper options but no I recommend paying the extra to get this one it’s so worth it, feels and sounds premium.????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Compact with great sound.,4,This is the third JBL Flip that I have owned.  They keep making improvements to them and I find this speaker a great value for the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What I needed,5,Works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disappointed  in the battery life,4,"Had better experience with the JBL Flip 3.Have to keep it constantly charged, in order for it to work and even then, it turns off after running for more that 20 mins...Without the charge attached to the wall, it doesn't work...Battery worked for the first  2 months then had problems since..Physically Looks good, sound quality is average.It may have had a defect  from the beginning that was somehow missed or ignored...The packaging and the shipping had no issues.It was well packaged."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Discontinued Product,5,"Love love love the color! I bought this Flip 4 as a birthday gift for my younger sister. She loves the sound quality and portability. Not to mention the waterproof capabilities since she listens to music in the shower. I myself am a tad jealous since the older brother of the JBL Flip 4-the Flip 5-doe not have an auxiliary input, whereas the Flip 4 has a standard 3.5mm input jack. All-in-all a great speaker for a reasonable price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great unit,5,This item works just as advertised.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can’t go wrong with JBL,5,"Bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loves it. I already had the larger JBL myself so i knew they made quality speakers, but this one is just great.  Much more portable than mine since it is smaller, but still has outstanding sound.  And the battery seems to last forever. She’ll go days without charging it, even though she uses it almost every day. Quite frankly, I don’t think that I will ever buy another portable, Bluetooth speaker, unless it’s a JBL speaker. I have two now and both are great. Don’t look at other brands, just get a JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Sound quality is great, tho personally I want more bass, but that's just me asking to much for what it is. I want the bass depth of a massive woofer in a small speaker.Bluetooth connection was quick and easy with the multiple devices in our home.It's size is perfect to put in my bikes water bottle holder to have music to jam with while I ride, just a fun fact."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,This packs a LOT of sound into a small package.  Actual battery life is 4-5 hours
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound but battery kind of sucks,4,The sound is great and the Bluetooth range is impressive…..the battery seems to always be low so I have to plug it in while using it a lot of the time which defeats the purpose of a Bluetooth speaker. It could just be that I use it a lot so battery is always low and I do forget to plug it in overnight sometimes.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can’t hold a charge,5,It was working fine for almost two years then after that it stop holding a charge. Only really works wen it’s kept plugged in. And even that is sometime-ish! Other then that great speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Portable boom spkr,4,So far so good. Great colume & can travel w it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great audio, excellent speakerphone and flawless bluetooth connectivity & a stereo Mini input",5,"The reason I chose the Flip 4 as opposed to the Flip 5 is that the Flip 4 has a stereo mini input jack in the rear of the device. This allows me to use it as a soundbar at the office with the office television when necessary. I have owned a few Bluetooth speakers and the connectivity of the Flip 4 is the best I have experienced. The Flip 4 is also an excellent speakerphone. These days, work frequently requires Zoom calls and this device performs the audio function admirably"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","For price and sound would be a 5 star, but...",4,"I was using this for watching movies in my RV. Sounds great, however lower levels of the movie the audio would cut out. Then when dialog came back the first couple words the audio would be off.There are some ""fixes"" but they didn't work for me. So if you are planning on watching movies/tv audio I'd say pass. You'll be disappointed.  If listening to music like most, then it's great for the price!I got an Anker Soundcore Motion+ as a replacement. So far not disappointed in it by comparison to the Flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It sounds good for awhile  then speakers start to buzz,4,Connects great but sound quality  goes away quickly
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charge 4 and Flip 4 work together to make a great bluetooth set for the whole apartment,5,"We have the JBL Flip 4 and the Charge 4 that are able to sync together and provide coverage over the whole apartment, so that we can listen to the same thing in the kitchen, in the study, in the living room, in the bathroom or on the deck. Syncing is easy and intuitive, volume control on the secondary speakers is controlled individually, and you can ""pause"" them without interrupting anyone else's listening. Or, we can individually Bluetooth to a speaker, and listen to different things. Or, we use the speakers to amplify laptop sounds.These are perfect, simple to use, and easy to understand. We are so happy with them!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",easy hook up/sounds great,5,"should have bought a couple of these yrs ago. so glad i have one now, everything about it is great.. sound is perfect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",SUPERB,5,OMG!!!!!!! Absolutely FANTASTIC. Sound superb like loud as freak! Outside in the wind it made my asphalt rumble beneath my feet NO LIE!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and long battery life,5,Great price and sound!  Easy connection to my iPhone via blue tooth.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Still pretty good although there are better ones,4,My JBL 5 was stolen and I replaced it with this model because I saw it on sale. It's not as good as the JBL 5 but it does the job. The 5 has a much louder and fuller sound. I didn't want to pay 40 bucks more for the 5 so instead I ended up buying 2 JBL 4's and link them for better and louder sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,An amazing speaker and easily transportable. Also it’s a great color lol. It has amazing sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,Great little speaker. Powerfully enough to provide good sound and it looks very nice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,This has lasted longer and almost louder then and of my big Bluetooth speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL knows what's up,5,"I bought this speaker because I was looking to replace a low-end, four-year old Bluetooth speaker that I barely used anymore because it was starting to buzz. This time around I wanted something nicer, but I really was not into spending more than $100. I think this is probably the best quality speaker for your money available. This thing sounds simply fantastic and there's quite a bit of rumble to it for being about the size of a water bottle. I haven't submerged it in water (and probably I won't on purpose) but it definitely doesn't mind stray drops from inside the shower. I haven't had any issues with the Bluetooth connection, and after a few days of (casual) use, I haven't had to charge it yet. If you're like me and you need something quality so you don't have to be tied-in to your phone or computer (or god-forbid listen to music through your laptop speakers) this is a product a highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",save your money.,3,i really wanted to love this product :( but it starts to die super super quickly after about a month of having it ?? i’m really upset about that. i would not recommend anyone to buy this!!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it!,5,"I just got it, and I already hooked it up to the Bluetooth and wow, it sounds great! It’s little smaller then I expected, but like the fact that it’s a little more compact. So far it’s only been a few minutes, and I love it!  Has some good weight to it, great sound, cool looking, and it’s waterproof, which is very cool. I bought the camouflage one. I can hide it in the bushes. Lol.I was just excited over my new Bluetooth speaker, I had to write home about itIt’s been the 2nd day and I played it All day yesterday, right out of the box, until it almost went dead, so time to recharge.I think it has great bass, especially for the size. If you’re looking for real hard core bass, then go for the upper models, but I am very happy with the sound and product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Check FLIP 5 for the same price,4,"The delivery was awkward- the driver left it almost in the streets first and when I went to pick it up, it wasn’t there. Then I called and complained and the following day the driver actually followed the delivery instructions and I got it. Other than that, the speaker is good, however, I saw the offer for the Flip 5 at the same price soon after I ordered this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sleak & User friendly. Loud, But the freeway is louder",5,"For it's price, 5 stars. It does what it's meant to do: play sound at a relatively loud volume (or quiet) and not rattle or static the sound. It's been outside, been in the rain, dirt, and been dropped many times and still looks brand new. I havent even needed to wipe it off. Everything just bounces off it. It does fine crammed in a full backpack and is fun to carry around on its strap tied to it that comes with the speaker. Its shape is attractive and smart looking. Just all around really amazing and includes the necessary buttons and plug in ports on places that make sense on the speaker.My only complaint is on full blast with the car windows down on the freeway, it's audible, but not quite loud enough. So its loud enough everywhere but a car freeway, airport runway, and freight train horn."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overhyped bass,4,"I listen to mostly music that is not reliant on heavy bass in general and this unit seems to like to hype up the bass. It's not bad, but definitely bass heavy. I'll have to look into phone side eqtotrim that down a bit.Otherwise, solid, sturdy, looks good, probably best mic ifor phone calls n a speaker this under $100."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Superior sounds quality,5,"I have been happy with my gen 1 clip JBL speaker for about the last 7 years. I thought it was time to upgrade and I was looking around and saw the flip4. I pulled it out the box and instantly connected it to my iphone. The audio quality blew me away. With the 1 sub on each end and the units internal speakers, it really produced some great sounds from a unit that is not much bigger then your hand. I have to say I am excited to buy another one to create the surround sound feature. For under 100$ you really are paying for the best speaker technology has to offer. GReat buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't assume that 2 speakers will pair,4,"Bought a 2nd flip 4 because I liked the 1st one so much.  I assumed that - since it's 2018 - the flip 4s would sync and sound great together.  Perhaps I'm missing something but the only way that I can get them to sound good is to link them through the JBL connect app and set them to party mode.  They stay in party mode for just a few minutes and then switch to stereo mode? or something besides party mode and the sound delay is not enjoyable.  The app fails to discover both speakers on a regular basis; even though they are inches from the phone.  I've tried restarting my phone, shutting off blue tooth etc etc.  Googling this issue shows that it's a consistent problem.  JBL should not be touting this product as ""pairable"".  Alone, the speaker is good.  When trying to play more than one at one time, I'm beyond frustrated."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Only one star for now,5,"And... we're back.  They actually replaced the darn thing after a few emails back and forth, including sending me return shipment authorization.  As before, this speaker sounds great.  Service was satisfactory and the replacement arrived in good time.*****Got it in January.  Used it sparingly throughout the year, indoors only.  Now, when I turn it on it makes this odd sound (not the normal sound when it used to power up) and doesn't work.  So far the JBL folks have sent me emails to try resetting and other basic functions that I already tried after visiting their website.  So, for now, this review will be a 1.  If they ever stop sending me useless emails and actually get this thing to work again I'll amend my review.  It was great before this happened, but if it doesn't work after 8 months of light duty I'll rate it accordingly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surprised,5,"When buying a speaker for my daughter for Christmas, I was at my wits end.  So many choices, so many good names (like HK) that got bad reviews,  people I know saying that the onyx was the way to go.  People on here said otherwise.So for a not so expensive speaker, I was really hesitant about getting this.  I know JBL was the sh-- back in the day.  So on Christmas morning when I heard the amazing sound and surprising amount of bass coming from my daughter's room, I was really surprised.  I wish in would have gotten myself one of these.Every manufactured product is going to have good and bad reviews, good and bad parts/units.  Take a chance on this speaker.  For the price, it's really good.  Not like having 2 12"" subs hooked up, but for a mini speaker, this thing can get loud and still keep a good, crisp sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great lil speaker,5,"i got my first jbl flip around 2013 and loved it. i still love it use it to this day although the battery life isn’t what it used to be. i bought this newer model as a gift for my dad and he loves it too. he was shocked by the sound quality compared to its size. i ended up purchasing one for myself and i’m just as happy as ever. buy this, you really won’t regret it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,"I really love this speaker. It is relativly light and has an easy transportable size. There is a handy string connected to the back which can be used to hang up the speaker. Charges quickly (about an hour for fully charged) and lasts for a while depending on what volume you keep it set at. The sound quality is really really great and its actually kind of fun to watch the bass vibrating on either side of the speaker which does not distort the sound at all. The packaging was simple and easy to open. I have not tested if it is waterproof yet. One small point is that the speaker and inner packaging was sort of warm upon arrival, almost like the battery had heated it up. This may have been related to the delivery but worth mentioning. I 100% would recommend this speaker to anybody who needs a light durable bluetooth great quality sound system. Love this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Orange cord? Really? SMH,3,"I ordered the aqua colored speaker, which looks great and has great sound and connectivity, but WHY on Gods green earth would you send it with an ORANGE / SALMON colored charging cord? Sticks out like a sore thumb!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Easy to use, excellent sound quality, waterproof",5,"This is the third time I've bought this now (first two were stolen), and it's still worth buying!  Great sound, solid battery life, waterproof (I've spilled drinks on it multiple times, but I haven't submerged it in a pool or anything). I use it when working around the house all the time.  Shockingly good sound quality for a little speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Won’t charge,3,"Love the speaker, but now won’t charge. I kept it in a case and never wet, but still died on me. Disappointed in JBL this time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,I loooove this! I use it on my photoshoots and now when I bike ride and the quality is perfect! I should of bought two so I can link them in the house when I’m moving around. I will say the life of the battery lasts for days if you don’t use it longer than an hour each day but 4 hours was the max for me on this device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Awesome speaker, disappointing battery life.",4,"This speaker is good quality but the battery life is awful; if I get 4 hours out of it I'm lucky; seems to average around 3 hrs.  The sound quality is amazing.  Easily connects to Bluetooth and piggybacks with other JBL speakers.  Just wish the battery lasted as long as they promised.  My friend bought one as well, his has the same problem, so it's not just that mine is a defect.  Overall, not a bad purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is not as advertised but is still good,4,The info for the product (JBL Flip 4) said it supports up to 12 hours of play but I have used it at full charge several times and 6-7 hours seems like a more accurate estimate. This works me though because I only use it at work for 3-4 hours at a time. It is convenient to carry and the sound quality is fantastic.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hope you have an outlet nearby,2,"Bought this speaker to replace my anker soundcore bluetooth speaker; was excited when it came in the mail only to be disappointed the next day.First impression, the sound is pretty great with the bass being a major upgrade from the anker. The sound is comparable as well, great for small rooms. The bass however gets lost once you get to the highest volumes. Gets 4 starsThe battery however, I'd give it less than one star if I could. I've seen sporadic reviews mentioning this issue, yet I hoped it wouldn't get to me. First time the speaker died I didn't think much of it, just charge it and try again the next day. Next day, speaker died again after little use. Now I'm getting frustrated, especially because of the price of this thing. My previous anker soundcore speaker never had a battery issue, meanwhile this JBL speaker which was much more expensive had to be charged continuously. Decided to time it; about 3 4 hours and this speaker is dead, a forth of what was advertised.Not cool.If you thought you were gonna be blasting the tunes while you're cleaning or something, you better think again cause this thing will die on you. Best have an outlet nearby, which defeats the purpose of a wireless speaker.After 4 days of having this thing in my possession, I regret the purchaseOhAlsoUnlike my cheaper longer lasting anker speaker, this JBL speaker doesn't display the battery life on your device's screen.Wack"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Battery Life-White turns dirty,4,"Legit love this speaker. Got it for my beach vacation and use it all the time. I work at a summer childcare program and play music most of the day. This speaker’s battery life lasts me about 3 days. The only negative thing about the white JBL is it’s looking a bit dirty. Besides that, not a bad little speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good value,4,"This is a good value. Sound quality, volume, and battery life are decent, but not reference quality or anything. Id say it lasts 4 to 6 hours on a full charge at low to moderate volumes. Seems fairly rugged. It has the mini usb for charging, I wish it had the usb c port. It does still seem to charge in a reasonable time. I had no issues with my Samsung S8 phone connecting or controlling volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and works well with my S4 Andriod,5,My JBL Flip has awesome sound and works well with my S4 Andriod.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Customer Service,5,I chose this speaker because I've had excellent experiences with JBL and wanted  high quality.  After receiving I had trouble getting my iPhone and laptop to recognize it.  I contacted this seller thru Amazon to explain my problem and ask for help.  The owner of the store contacted me immediately and patiently walked me thru the process.  Later his technician called to follow up.  Customer Service is what it's all about.  They went above and beyond what I normally expect from a seller.  The speaker is exactly what I expected and this seller was amazing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Spectacular sound paired in stereo,5,"These are amazing sounding speakers solo or paired in stereo; however, pairing in stereo is something special. The amount of bass and fullness and separation of sound is incredible. I’d rather listen to these than my much more expensive surround sound system. The JBL app to link them is wonky and pairing to voice commands is still a work in progress. I got one to use in the shower, but I’m using the paired stereo mode in the living room all the time. The UE Wonderboom 2 can’t compare sound wise. Highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,4,Simple and fast to connect to.Great value
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good, clean, crisp sound",4,"Nice, crisp, clean sound. I do not agree with some reviewers who complain that there's not enough bass. My complaint is that most headphones and speakers these days have too much. I listen mostly to jazz and classical, and I want a balanced sound with good mid-range and highs. I am frequently finding too much bass even with 'bass reducer' on.  Custom equalization in the speakers and headphones themselves are probably the only way to satisfy everyone.  I like the sound of this however.I dropped a star for this reason: there is no way to skip back a song and that is really annoying. Every other speaker/headphone/earbud I own has a way to skip backwards -- this is the first device without that ability and they need to fix that. I'm also not wild about all the loud, weird noises it makes going on and off -- like a spaceship taking off and landing. They should offer a way to disable that."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound,5,"Amazing sound, long lasting battery, rugged too"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker with awesome sound and easy to use!!,5,"We bought this to take out on our party barge, but it is so handy we use it al the time.  We sat out on the back patio with friends and just grabbed it, connected, and played tunes for about 4hrs, still had plenty  of power left.  Sounds great, quality is great and so easy to use!  We also paired it with a friends with the JBL App and had surround sound in stereo!  Awesome!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny,5,"A Co-worker of mine has the same one as me, pretty much the main reason i got it with how good it sounded with a good price, i regret nothing"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound quality particularly the Bass is stellar,5,I have several bluetooth speakers and the JBL is the absolute BEST!!! Will eventually get the bigger model so I can blast the whole house (:- )
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth isn’t great,3,Bluetooth stopped connecting well after the first day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is very good and the volume goes up really loud.  It connects easy and never gets disconnected. The battery life is good. I suggest this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bumps like mad,5,"Hands down one of my favorite purchases. $80 can be a loud number, but so is the speaker. It handles any bass boost flawlessly, and the sound carries a very good distance. The JBL link feature works wonderful when friends bring their speakers too, becauze the link system lets us have surround sound with no delay between speakers. Charge lasts a long, long time, even on full blast.I've taken this speaker across the country and on all kinds of excursions and it has performed without fault. I use it on runs, hikes, showers, snowboarding, parasailing, or even just to drown out someone else's music. I would recommend not letting it play music underwater (if you drop it in a pool or such) for very long as the water will leak into the power button. (Doesn't affect performance or get into the actual speaker, but takes a while for the water to evaporate out.)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will not power on,5,"I replaced my iphone to the 11. I had to reset the device because it would not brodcast the bluetooth signal. While doing this the Flip powered down. It looked like it reset. However, Now it will only light up when I plug it in. The battery is new and the device is not that old. When researching the issue it is a known issue. The board that controls the buttons has gone bad. Now it is a just a paper weight. I will never buy JBL again. This is a known issue that they have not fixed.Update... contacted JBL and they replaced the item without any issue. I have changed the rating to 5 star."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ultimate Golf Buddy!,5,You will really like this one!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Speaker,4,"At this time in my life I do not have internet in my house, I know what do I live in a cave? So I wanted to get a speaker that I can connect my phone too and play music since it is so quiet in my house.  The battery does last a while. I believe I had it playing for about 6 hours and had enough battery to continue to play. I think my phone died before the speaker did.One thing I did notice was when I had music on and then I would receive a phone call the speaker would make this weird noise. I would have to take my phone call off of Bluetooth mode.All in all, this was a great buy and a good price. I am very happy with my choice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty great.,4,"Bought this at the last second when my old sound “system” for Halloween got too old to handle music on new phone.Set up was easy, sound is great. Is it the BEST SPEAKER EVER?? No. But, I had them all the way up, playing music with serious bass, for hours Halloween night. At very highest volume there was a tiny bit of distortion but not enough to be a deal breaker.Would be great for the beach, pool, whatever.Right now using it in the batting cage outside. Sounds great.They’re good looking too.I would say they are round so assuming they’re meant to be set on one end. Have to be careful not to knock them over. Put them down sideways and they’ll roll.But the camo looks awesome.Haven’t tried synching two of them. JLB Connect app has crappy scores in the iTunes Store. I wasn’t willing to risk it on Halloween. I’ll try that later.Mostly happy with purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Does the trick,4,"Overall pretty happy with this purchase. Trying to figure out how to manage a floaty so that it can float next to us while we're sitting in the water. The Bluetooth connection is our only question mark, but it may be our MP3 player. When we tried it with a cell phone the Bluetooth connection did seem stronger"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than the $99 Bose I returned,5,"Really love my JBL speaker had so many problems with the $99 Bose waterproof speaker I got this one and really enjoy the sound easy Bluethooth connection, I wish the battery life was a little longer.  The only other thing I would change is the power connection, those tiny connecters seem easily to bend or not fit very well.  I would like to have seen the USB type since I have more than my fair share of those laying around.  Time will tell but have had the JBL more than a month and very pleased."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must buy,5,The sound quality on this little device is beyond what I imagined. The sound isn’t muffled and give just the right amount of base. Small but very powerful. Holds charge for a long time too
"JBL Flip 4, Black",FANTASTIC PIECE OF GEAR!,5,"Just got my JBL FLIP 4.  It arrived quickly in the mail.  I quickly paired it to my older Galaxy S8 phone.  Very simple to connect, used the internet to find simple instructions.  The sound is amazing for such a small device...about the size of a small water bottle.  I will definitely enjoy working on my projects outside.  Haven't rated battery life since I haven't tested it yet.  I love this piece of gear!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I be bumpin the Dodger game at work,5,"Its a great speaker. Deep bass, and pretty loud. The battery life is normal from what you would get out of a typical speaker. The Bluetooth range is at least 30’. There is just one thing I disliked about it which probably more of a personal problem and that is the texture of the speaker. The feel of it in my hands drives me nuts. Its a very weird feeling."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great quality, sound is perfect",5,"Great sound quality, durable, easy to take everywhere."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Getting annoying,3,"I've used this for 5 months daily...I can barely hear a phone call, while the music/podcasts are plenty loud. I recently started using Bluetooth earbuds, and this JBL speaker will turn itself on over and over again and just take over. I have to unpair the speaker from my phone while I'm not using it. I want to like it more but it's getting annoying."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Did hold a charge,2,Sent it back cuz it didn’t hold a charge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,I couldn't figure out how to turn this unit On at first.  Lousey instructions!  I went on line and watched a Video and realized I just wasn't pushing down hard enough on the On button.  At first the Unit seemed to have too much Base and I was able to adjust the sound quality via my LG phone using the Equalizer graph and was amazed to see how well the speakers preformed over the entire range of music and different types of songs.  The quality was superb!!!  I'm very happy with the JBL Flip 4 and would recommend it to anyone...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,5,The sound is amazing! I had the gen 1 for several years and it sounded great. This is gen 4 and the sound is amazing The only issue I'm having is it will disconnect from the Bluetooth on its own. Even with the device sitting next to it. Then I have to go into my connections close the speaker then open it again. Then it seems to stay after that.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,"Can't go wrong with this portable waterproof speaker. It sounds excellent, takes its fair share of abuse, is lightweight, and it really is great when you need a little sound in an inconvenient place (like when you go hiking, or in the shower). I use it every night for playing various white noise ambient soundtracks like wind and rain and it sounds great and lulls me right off to sleep every night."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it great sound,5,Great for your money
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great outdoor speaker for the price,5,"This little speaker is really great for the backyard, tailgates, and hanging out around the fire pit with the family. The sound quality is on the better side of average and quite good for the size and price. It is as weather proof as advertised. I leave it hanging up on our shade canopy in the backyard for weeks at a time through wind and heat and it has not had a problem after surviving a Texas summer. The battery is surprisingly long lasting. Thats definitely the biggest positive in my eyes since it’s always ready to go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very dissatisfied of the product.,5,I bought the JVl Bluetooth and within 3 months didn’t work.  I wish it can be replaced or get my refund because when it worked was the best to listen.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ultimate purchase.,5,I got this for Christmas. Great sound for its size and weight. Sounds just as good as larger versions we see in the beach.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for all life’s adventures!,5,"This speaker has been a great addition to our household. Not only do we use it at home on a regular basis, we’ve also used it on a beach vacation, on our boat, at my husband’s recreational softball games and my husband takes it with him when he plays golf. It has great battery life, lasting for days depending on how long we use it. Great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It packs a punch and so portable,5,"Honestly, this little speaker packs a Bunch. Hubby and I needed a quick easy way to bring out some tunes while we kick back at the fire table with a beer and contemplate the day. It’s small enough to fit in my purse/bag to take on trips. Not that we have gone anywhere yet, but when that day comes when we can get back out to backyard bbqs and gatherings at the beach this baby is coming."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",the best purchase I made last year,5,"This is hands down, the best purchase I made last year! I have decent audio systems in the house, but find myself using this more often when I'm just in the kitchen, or when I'm in the shower, or when I'm outside. It works well outside when we have BBQs, and is loud enough for our backyard. It's definitely loud enough in the house and can easily fill a large room. I often use it as a car speaker when I'm driving my vintage car that doesn't have speakers. It's good even with windows down. The sound quality is excellent with good balance and mids, and the waterproofing is a nice feature since I use it when camping too. It's super rugged and durable... used it a ton and have taken it many places this last year. It charges fast, and the battery life is great! It'll last a decent chunk of the day on higher volumes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this blue tooth speaker!,5,"Great price, sound, 12 hrs of life per charge, and looks amazing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for two years.,3,"Great speaker connects with other flips easy and brilliantly! However, after gentle used for two years the battery barely lasts five minutes after a full charge and this one’s charge port won’t charge it anymore which essentially makes it an expensive paperweight. Would recommend with the caveat that you’ll probably only get about 2 years worth out of it. I bought multiple flips so as to connect all for several parties. Worked wonderfully, but now multiple are having charging/battery issues all around 2 year mark."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","No  Dura  lo k dice  ,,solo  5 hras  y  no me gusto  eso  k la compré Por  Alta duración",3,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Esta  bien el sonido  solo k no  dura  mas  k 5 horas  la  batería  y decia k  duraba 10  por esa razón la devolvere"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound with a boom,5,"I have to say for a speaker of this size it has a very rich sound. The loudness is very good. It delivers sharp and crisp sound at any volume. The bass is surprising for it’s size. The cable it comes with for charging is not great. I got 3 of them and while the speaker is awesome the cable is crappy and the first thing to go, but don’t let that deter you the speaker is good. It’s a common cable, just be prepared to get another one later down the road."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",FINALLY a great speaker at a reasonable $,4,"Best portable speaker I ever bought.  No logging in, just hit the power button and you are connected.  High volume, great base for the space I need.  Excellent in the back yard for parties where it's just loud enough not to tee off your neighbors.  Charging when I'm at 25% juice is faster than expected.  Good investment for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",big price increase btwn june and december,5,the price increased from $70 to $105 between june and december.  it's a great speaker.  easy to use (i'm tech challenged). reliable. lightweight. waterproof. easy to charge.  battery is long-lasting.  small and portable.  can use anywhere. great sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small and loud!,5,Perfect little speaker with plenty of volume!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AWESOME speaker,5,"I bought this after  my Radio Shack cheapie finally gave out. I thought I would upgrade since I really like that these speakers usually sound great.  They're great for my office!  I bought another for my house.  I just hang it out on the patio when we're by the pool and you have no problem hearing them.  If you need more sound, you can link another to it.  When I know I'm going to have more people over, I just take the one from my office home and link it and set it on the other side of the patio.  This way everyone has music.  They're not as light as my other speaker, but I'm assuming it's due to the quality.  These sound 100 times better and fill the room."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Fantastic speaker with killer battery life! I've used it for about 4hrs total now and I haven't even gotten close to needing to charge it.Bought to go into my car which system doesn't work and it's been amazing. It syncs to my phone without hesitation and that's huge when you're busy.The party and sound system perks are lost on me for now but I am exacted to use them.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than most other Bluetooth speakers!,5,I have had this same speaker for quite a long time.  Our friends really liked it so I bought another one as a Christmas gift for them. Great sound for its size. It's ideal for the patio as well as indoors. I highly recommend it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound quality!,5,"The JBL Flip 4 has amazing bass and it is the best portable speaker that I have ever had! The sound quality when turned up high, is amazing as well! The only thing I dislike is the battery life. I definitely have not gotten 12 hrs battery life out of this in one charge like it says you will get. But it charges fast and I hope that it stays that way. I also was able to listen to music while it charged. I read a review where someone said you cannot listen to music while it charged, but I did! Also, I work in a huge kitchen that serves 750-800 people each meal, and this speaker can be heard above all of the choas of everyone in the kitchen and it isnt even turned up all the way, the sound stays crisp and clear, good job JBL, Thank you!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE JBL 3 and 4,5,"This is my second one, I had the 3 and it lasted about 4 years and it finally peter'd out (it works for about 20 minutes or so and then it dies so I just go the JBL 4 and I couldn't be happier with the slightly larger size and the sound is amazing.I just wished that Amazon notified me that it was coming a day earlier and rang my door bell to inform me that my expensive item was left sitting on my front porch without me knowing about it?  Otherwise, I am happy with this brand and this item."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speakers,4,These are really great speakers. I bought a pair of them and I sync them up on my patio to the Spotify app and you got a nice little concert.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice big full sound from little speakers,5,"Overall, very happy with these small speakers due to the big full sound. I bought two so I could have music playing in separate rooms, and my only drawback, which is very picky and minor, is that you have to connect the music to one of them first each time you play music....and then connect that one to the other one so they play as a set.....they don't just instantly connect as a set from your device and both immediately play the same music. But overall, very satisfied and happy with these JBLs."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Drops connection constantly,2,Great sound but drops connectivity all the time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent small speaker!,5,"Great sound from a small speaker.  Easy connection, just turn it on and it remembers you.  Bad Android app, is confusing and quirky! I also have 2 ""Pulse 4"", getting those to pair up in stereo is a task every time. Good volume for most situations.  Size about a soda can and a half."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The JBL speaker is giving at the Club vibes sound quality,5,"This speaker is amazing, the sound quality is so good, I felt as if I was at the club speaker dancing.  I highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",perfect for me,5,"I LOVE this little guy. My cousins have the black one and we're always borrowing it but I needed one of my own for beach/fishing trip days... Naturally, I googled what the best bluetooth speakers were out right now and the JBL Flip 4 was listed. I was thrilled when I came across a camo version!! I haven't fully submerged it into water, and I don't suggest anyone does that lol, but it held up just fine through rain on the boat for several hours. Can't say much about the battery life yet, no issues so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JUST BUY IT.......,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Amazing. It's way better than my old Sony Bass Boosted bluetooth speaker. It was an XB20. COMPARING THE XB20 TO THIS FLIP 4 Pshhhhhhh..... Way better. Sure the sony BB has strobe lights but it doesn't have speakers that surround most of the speaker limiting the volume output. I saw this specific speaker on youtube top 5 in budget. I highly recommend if you don't wanna spend $250 for the Bose bad boy speaker (not actual name)Anyways to summarize!BUY THIS SPEAKER!  READ ALL INFO BEFORE YOU BUY. LOOK UP EVERY INFORMATION YOU CAN BEFORE YOU CONFIRM. THEN BUY ONE... NAWH BUY TWO!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great (loud) speaker for the price!,4,"This is one trusty little speaker. I originally was going to purchase the sonos sound system, but ended up getting this since my husband already has one in Black. Mostly because he really likes his, and I like the idea that we could sync our two speakers together. It does the job for its small size, and the sound quality is pretty good to for the price. It can get very loud, and the small subwoofer(?) on the end gives it a nice bass. Overall I’m happy I chose this!Pros: cylindrical design  Portability  Charge time is very fast  Loud & quality sound  Easy to pair & use  Good priceCons:  The orange jbl logo is bright. It don’t care for how  it stands out.  This particular listing doesn’t come with a charger which suck but a android charger does the trick."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny!,5,This little speaker has great sound. I love being able to control the sound from my phone unlike other speakers. I love that I can use it while I’m in the shower and not worry about the steam ruining it. I didn’t have any problems connecting it to my phone. I’m not tech savvy and I could do it easily. It doesn’t drop even when I take my phone into another room.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little speaker loud,5,Love it I only have to charge it once a week and I use it everyday
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect speaker,5,"I bought one similar a few years ago and all the sudden it would not connect to my phone but I LOVE this one. The battery lasted for such a long time and it was super easy to pair with great sound quality. It is pretty loud for how little it is. Easy to take to the lake, use in the garage or in the bathroom."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Was excellent but became worse over time.,2,"I got the product strictly for in-car use. Fits in the cup holder no problem and has excellent sound quality when in use. I only use the speaker for 20-25 minute drives twice a day. The speaker always comes home or is out of direct sunlight to avoid weather and temperature issues.Battery life based on my usage lasts for about 2-3 weeks when I first got it on a full charge. It eventually stabilized at 2 weeks. I listen to music at half volume.The batter after 3 months degraded to 1-1.5 weeks from a full charge based on the same usage. One time the speaker refused to turn on, I brought it home, put it to charge and the battery indicator turned on listing 3/5 charge remaining. It worked after that no problem. Another time while driving, the speaker suddenly cut off and stopped the song. Turned it back on and the song started over.At the time of the review 1/12/2020, the speaker still maintains a 1-1.5 week battery life, where the battery remains strong 5/5 to 4/5 battery life in the first week, and rapidly decreases in the next 2-4 days. Just this past week I have had trouble turning the speaker on, charge cable brought it back to life at 3/5 battery; trouble with bluetooth connectivity; I have had the speaker cut off, stop the current song, pressed play and the song started over again 9 times within the same 20 minute drive. Verified it was not due to the road conditions as 1 out of the 9 times happened while parked at a gas station.While this is an excellent product and does exactly what I want it to, the rapidly deteriorating battery life with minimal usage and extreme caution when handling the speaker becomes a massive drawback over time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s really one of the best investments I’ve had in awhile,5,I like how the base isn’t outing the rest of the song or video.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery ?? life is amazing. Sounds is loud for a mini speaker ??,5,
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better then expected...,5,"I work in a factory... It is noisy... I have tried many different music making time killer solutions over the years (yes years)... My music requirements have changed because I no longer want to share my music with my surrounding coworkers... Now a lot of them use earbud headphones and don't enjoy my old time rock and roll... My last successful attempt was the JBL Xtream speakers, very nice a bit too loud and a bit too heavy to carry in my work backpack... I tried to use my old Jawbone original and it was no way cutting it, but the size was perfect... So I thought maybe somebody has made something similar size and more powerful... I already liked JBL, so the JBL Flip 4 was something that may work... After all these years I think maybe I have found the perfect speaker... It really is very loud for its size..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Spend the cash,3,"This is not a bad speaker at all. Its just worth spending the extra $10 Bucks for the Flip 5. Trust me you will be happier with the overall quality of sound for the size and the money. If the quality of sound is important get the Flip 5. I gave this to my child and ordered the F5 after listening to what the difference really is. You can hear it clearly when you play both at the same time and compare. The F5 is slightly larger, you cant tell with a naked eye. You literally have to sit them next to each other to see the size difference. There is a low octave base that is missing from the F4 and it makes a difference.  This a a great gift for a teen or younger or if your just trying to save a few bucks and really don't care about the quality of sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",this JBL speaker has great sound,5,"I wasn't sure how much quality could come from a speaker at this cost and size, but the treble and bass are great for all genres of music. battery life is excellent. easy to connect multiple devices as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,We purchased these speakers as gifts since we have one and love it!  The sound is amazing for the size and price!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lo máximo,5,Funciona excelente
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Love the sound, color, and compactness.",5,"Great product! Love the color, compactness, and sound. I like the color and sturdiness of the charging cable too. I use it to charge other products and use it as a main charger for things with the same plug type.Easy to connect my iPhone with bluetooth also. Not sure about battery life, as I don't use it for that long yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Built to Last,5,"I’ve had this thing for a couple years now, and it still works just as great, is just as sturdy, and sounds ‘factory new.’ This speaker was clearly built to last, as it withstood water and other liquid-y things in its lifetime. So cool to look at the subwoofers while the bass and kicks sound too. I’ve had a lot of great memories with this speaker, whether it be hanging out with friends and singing our lungs out or blasting it in the shower."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Product.,5,"Works like a charm, ive dropeed it in a pool and it sounds like a charm and its waterproof. It also has amazing sound quality and a great bass."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The BEST!!,5,"Really great speaker. Even has subwoofers!!! Lol get it, you won’t regret it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and perfect for outdoors.,5,"I purchased this speaker after my son brought his to the house.  After hearing how great the sound was, I decided to get one to use outside by the pool.  I am not disappointed.  Even with the pump running, the speaker puts out quality sound at a volume you can hear well.  Great speaker for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Great speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's wonderful!,5,I just love it!!! Sound is great!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect Sound Quality!!!,5,Love everything about my new purchase of Bluetooth Portable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,"Everyone in the house enjoyed my JBL flip  4 so much I got one for my stepdaughter for Christmas for her college apartment. Otherwise mine probably would have conveniently disappeared.Great speaker, nice sound. I obviously recommend it if I bought a 2nd one. Easily paired with my other JBL for great sound over a large area at an outdoor graduation party."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A Great Bluetooth Speaker!,5,"I have smaller bluetooth speakers but wanted something that could be louder. Have used JBL sound equipment before so I know they make good products.The build quality is fantastic and looks great.The sound quality is really good, until you get closer to topping it out. If you top it out, the sound seems slightly distorted. However, I have not needed to top out the sound because it is really loud before that point.The battery life is really good with this model. I usually use it for outside when in the pool with my kids or doing stuff outside on my deck. I have run it 3 or 4 hours without a need to recharge.Overall, this is a great bluetooth speaker and really gives you great sound for a great price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great little speaker,5,I am super pumped about this speaker.  I have wanted one for a couple years now and finally purchased in preparation for a beach trip.  It is my favorite color and has a great sound.  I thought I would mention I found a surprise use.  I have a Roku 4 that has the headphone jack for quiet viewing.  Well you can use the jbl speaker with the Roku remote to bring the music from Pandora or other music apps by connecting them with a male to male audio cord. you connect it in the 3.5 headphone jack that is also meant to connect another speaker for increased sound.  So now I can take my little speaker and Roku remote out on the back patio and listen to music without having to use up phone battery and don't have to leave the door open to hear the music from our sound system inside.  So pleased!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality Speaker at a Reasonable Price,5,Nice speaker.  Pleased with it.  Well made and good value.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life not good,2,Battery life doesn’t last long and won’t let you charge while it’s on sometimes. It’s very finicky. Would not recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perdida del sonido el primer segundo cuando se usa en auxiliar,1,"Queria una bocina con auxiliar para poder usarla con mi equipo de computo también sin tener retraso en el audio. Pero me encontré con dos grandes inconvenientes.1. La bocina tiene que encenderse para poder usarla con jack (Lo cual muchos dispositivos/audifonos no requieren. Además, al encenderla se activa automaticamente el BT y para mi que tengo 5 dispositivos conectados a la bocina tener que estar viendo en cual dispositivo está conectado para evitar interferencias con el sonio del jack (por que si, lo tiene de momentos ,se corta el audio por esto y es imposible evitar desde la bocina) es muy molesto.2. El sonido por el jack quitando el problema de arriba, es bueno. No obstante, si reproduces un video, un sonido/audio o algo, notarás que aun estando por auxiliar de momentos el sonido del primer segundo se pierde. lo cual es particularmente molesto principalmente en audios pues desde el primer segundo hay voces diciendo cosas y en mi caso que reproduzco seguido la pronunciacion de ciertas palabras por aprendizaje tengo que hacerlo dos veces seguidas para poder escucharla a la segunda vez"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound perfection for days!!!,5,"A bluetooth speaker that blows its competition out of the water! With sound so clear you can see through it, this portable, waterproof speaker is one of my best investments yet. Even at max on my phone and the speaker, sound came out crisp and clear with no crackling, static buzz or wierd noise. Has a super long range (about 100 feet), and the battery lasts and lasts. A fishing/camping must-have!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth speaker so why did I rate it 2 STARS!  Read on...,2,"The Pro is it is a nice, good sounding speaker for a Bluetooth speaker.  The Con, and it is a BIG CON, is the USB connection on the speaker.  The inside of the connect (middle connector that goes into the wire) is very flimsy and will bend eventually.  It cannot be straightened out and is throw away junk at this point since you are not able to charge it.  Sad since I enjoy it's performance."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",perfect for any occasion,4,"I'd been doing research on different portable blue tooth speakers and purchased two others.  This one - hands down is the winner: easy to carry, easy connectivity, great sound, and battery lasts about 6 hours if played continuously - how do I know?  I listen to rain sounds when going to bed .  I take it w. me every time I think it may be useful.  Hasn't failed me yet.  Good purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Bluetooth speaker for the money.,4,"I have this in the garage so when I am working in the yard or in the garage, I can play my Spotify playlists. The teal blue is a great color, sounds is pretty good, but not as good as my JBL Charge 2, which is on my nightstand. I listen to relaxation playlists on it to fall asleep at night."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent speaker. Very versatile.,5,Nothing I don’t like. Highly recommended.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best!,5,They sound perfect!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT little speaker except for ther weird loud noise connecting to bluetooth,4,"Review would be 5 stars all the way if only it did not make the weird, unnecessarily loud noise when connecting to and disconnecting from bluetooth. i think it's supposed to be a pleasant musical chord which it most definitely is NOT! plus there is no way to control its volume.Also, i am a little ticked off that the description did not include the fact that a very nice zippered black carrying case with wrist strap is included. i purchased one at the same time because it was suggested in the ""Frequently bought together"" section and i thought it would be good to have on my upcoming beach vacation. Just a waste of money, don't really need a spare, and shipping cost to return it is more than half the cost of the case."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great but they don’t give u the charger jack,4,We like this very much but were disappointed that they didn’t include a charger jack plug in with this boxed up item.Had to order the $11 plug jack separately.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very easy to use,5,I like the great sound.  I didn’t like the limited sound adjustment that can be made.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome little speaker!,5,"I’m so pleased I took a punt on this little speaker. I have a big old Beats boombox that I was using but carrying it from room to room was a pain. So that is now staying in my garage gym because this little speaker is just what I needed. It’s actually louder than I expected it to be, sound quality is great and the battery life is good considering I use it several hours a day. I’m only charging it once a week just now. I haven’t had any problems connecting it to my iPhones following the original syncing. For the price I am super happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,4,"Need to charge frequently, could be louder , Bluetooth connectivity issues"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Bluetooth Speaker!  Worth the Investment!,5,"Sounds fantastic!  An unexpected sound out of a small, little speaker.  It's also splash proof!  I could not ask for a better portable speaker.  Easily syncs to your devices Bluetooth and holds charge for several sittings of listening to music.  The volume is also controlled from your phone or device which is great because you do not have two different items you must control the volume on.  If your phone or device is on max volume, so is the speaker and vice versa.  Amazon also beat the price of other retailers.  I was going to buy the item at Wal-Mart.  Taxes and all was approximately $108.00.  Amazon beat the price significantly.  I am very impressed with this portable Bluetooth speaker.  Worth the investment if you like listening to music while sitting on the porch, backpacking, camping, working in the shop, and etc."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wears out fast,4,"This was a gift for my husband that we have had for awhile now. At first, the sound quality was great. Now, it makes fuzzy sounds at certain volumes. The charge is also pretty crap now. It will say fully charged but then a few minutes of use later it’ll turn off as if it died and then you have to keep it plugged in to use it again. We also haven’t used it a whole lot either since we’ve gotten it, so it wears out faster than it should. Other than that it has been pretty handy and of decent quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","JBL quality. I like it. however, slightly weak bass",4,"JBL has the best and longest lasting battery and that was the reason I bought this.as I expected it, it is JBL!!!!  Everything works perfect and battery life is as advertised and I am very happy with it.then, why not 5 star?  the bass is slightly weaker than I had imagined.  But very good BT speaker. I am a happy customer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING SOUND,5,I purchased this product on advice from a co-worker (I work as a letter carrier for USPS) and the sound is amazing. It fits right on the dash of the mail truck and the Bluetooth connection has so far been very consistent after one week's use. I've used it for listening to tunes on my iPod Touch as well as baseball games from streaming radio on my iPhone. Good bang for the $.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Me encanto definitivamente lo volvería a comprar,5,Me encanta como suena
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good sound in a small package,5,"I bought a different no-name brand Bluetooth speaker. It was so bad I didn’t want to use it. The flip4 sounds really good. I prefer it to my Bose Soundlink. The battery surprised me with how long it lasts. I played 4 hours of moderate volume tunes and when I plugged it in to charge, only 1 led was flashing(I think 80% charged). Easy to connect to both my iPhone and laptop. Good range too. I was outside in the woods about 50 paces away and it didn’t loose connection. I like this speaker a lot."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker I've Ever Owned!,5,This little speaker packs a real punch for its size. The sound quality on this speaker is very crisp and clear and the base is quite deep. I've owned and tested many other speakers in its class and they can't compare. The durability on this thing is insane! I've thrown it town a 50ft staircase onto asphalt and no problem occurred. I've dunked it in water in multiple occasions and nothing happened. The battery life of this thing is also kind of amazing! But I've got to tell you that this speaker has its limits due to its size. It get the best quality use it in small/medium sized rooms or a small outdoor living spaces. Something this size has its limits. Besides that I highly recommend this speaker if your trying you make your final decision.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and battery life. Built tough.,5,"Just got it today, the sound is awesome, came in partially charged so I got to play with it. Sounded great even at maxed out volume. Cant wait for my next beach day! Will upgrade to 5 stars after a little use, depending on battery life and durability.Update: best beach speaker ever! Great battery life, even in the heat at the beach all day. Great sound also. I love my speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful,5,"It's a JBL speaker - it's freaken good! What more can I say.Update: so I put it in my oven so that it maximizes the bass, kinda like the same thing as when you put your smartphone in a cup or bowl to increase the bass and loudness... Well anyway I forgot it in the oven and turned my oven to 400... 10 minutes later I go back to open my oven cuz I wanted to leave it open at 400 for the heat .. and there was my JBL baking.. poor thing. But the magic is that it STILL WORKS PERFECTLY :) It didn't even melt at all!! It was hot af but it's just fine!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Happy with my choice,5,"The JBL Flip 4 has exceeded my expectations.  Great purchase.  Sound, ease of use and Value.  And looks great!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery only last 6 hours on my device.,4,"Sound- 5stars Bluetooth connectivity-3 starsBattery life-1 star. First day using my brand new camo Jbl flip 4. I could get away more then 25ft with phone on my pocket because music will stop playing and the worst thing I don’t like is the battery it only hold me 6 hours. I thought the label say 12 hours battery life but NO, ONLY 6 HOURS on my device !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!!!!!,4,Love it!!!! ? ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GOOD BUT NOT GREAT IF YOU NEED VOLUME,5,It will do. Great for portability to the beach and the sound quality is crisp and clear. However the off brand a friend  purchased a while back for me was MUCH Louder. At almost max level this JBL Flip 4 still sounds like personal space volume to me.  Not really great sounding for a small group at the beach or pool side for my Aqua Zunba class like I intended.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound from this little speaker!,5,"I was debating buying a Bose Bluetooth speaker so I did a little research and found a review from someone who had a Bose Bluetooth as well as this JBL Flip 4. He actually rated this one higher, so I decided to give it a try. For almost half the cost, this little JBL bluetooth speaker kicks out some serious sound and some serious bass!! I live in an apartment complex and so I don't need a huge system and this little speaker is perfect! Not only is the sound amazing, the battery lasts for days and you can use it to make phone calls and it also links together with other flip 4s so you can have a true surround sound experience if you have more than one of these speakers. I would definitely recommend the speaker to anyone looking for an affordable yet high quality device"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best sounding speaker in a portable unit.,5,"JBL’s bigger speakers may sound louder,  but they’re not convenient in terms of portability. It’s small size and light weight still gives you  more room and comfortable to carry even in a small backpack. Great for office space, dorms and small bedrooms, and light enough to carry in hiking and camping with enough battery to last for a day."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!!!,5,This is a great buy!! The sound is amazing and the battery life is also great!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,I like that sound a lot
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hopefully your box doesn’t come damaged,4,"This is a great speaker! Sound quality probably just as good as my charge 3. The only reason I dropped a star was for the way it came in the mail. Outside amazon box was fine, but the jbl box was highly damaged, looked as if it had been dropped at least a few times. Hopefully won’t cause damage to the speaker in the long run. Not sure if the damaged box was because of amazon or from the dealer that provides the speaker... if I’m reviewing the speaker, 10/10"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,4,"I have always liked JBL.  Great bluetooth  connectivity I was able to walk away from the speaker with my phone probably a good 75-80 feet and still didn't lose signal.  The only bad part is, they most rate the 12 hours of battery life at a very low volume..  I have tested it the last few days.  I got about 6 to 7 hours out of this speaker with the volume just over half way on my phone.  The speaker is loud..  Just wish the battery lasted longer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not waterproof,2,"I purchased this product during Covid shutdown 2020 since I was home most of the time and outside. Product states it is waterproof. Now, 2 years later, I dropped it in my swimming pool for the first time, and it turns off unexpectedly and also turns on unexpectedly. So, when it turns on unexpectedly, and I’m in the middle of a phone call, I have to turn off my Bluetooth in my phone settings so keep my calls private and not blasted through my JBL speaker. Asked seller for refund, but warranty has expired. Aside from this waterproof failure, I really enjoyed the speaker. Nice and loud and great sound quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You should have one. Or 2.,5,"JBL has been doing sound for a long time and it shows. Even though all my old JBLs still work, I recently purchased this and a Charge 4 for the Party Boost. I should have just ordered two of these Flip 4s. It's a rocking little speaker that fills so much more space than it takes up. Totally love it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice little speaker - not as “bass heavy” as Beats Pill,4,"Nice little speaker. It’s the exact same size as the Beats Pill we have. The Beats Pill is much heavier in the bass. This Flip 4 is very comparable and seems to be a bit tougher built but we’ll see; it sits on the floor in the gym, so it may take a while."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fun by the Pool,5,"I hate to workout without music!  This little speaker was all I needed.  The sound is full, rich and has enough volume to be heard over the noisy pool equipment.  I love that it connects automatically when I turn it on.  Being waterproof makes it ideal to use by the pool.  Water aerobics can get splashy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The most bang for your buck,4,"For this price range I find the sound of this speaker to be excellent. It has an excellent range of sound concerning treble and base. I personally prefer this over the beats pill plus and I like the sort of fabric mesh that lays over the drivers. At the end it's like a hard rubber or tpu in case you drop it it'll take the shock of the drop. Over all, I am thoroughly impressed. If your wondering why I gave it only 4 stars it's because it's no sennheiser. The most bang for your buck and you can't tell it's cheap say like a soundbot model.  In the photos the blue USB is a separate cord, but still USB, and the Orange one is the one that is provided with the speaker. I found that to be unique and useful that the pin portion was flat versus the standard USB."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little speaker with a big sound,5,"I have an audio/video rental company and rent out a lot of JBL PRX and QSC equipment. Those are great for filling large venues. This little Flip 4 is great for personal use. This is perfect to bring along to the bedroom, kitchen, and hotel room. It gets plenty loud. It surprising has some deep end to it, but doesn't compare to something like a QSC K8 when it comes to lows. But that is OK because this wasn't meant to be used as a PA. Think of this as a premium personal speaker that you can throw in a bag. Bluetooth has been rock solid on my iPhone 8. The sound so far is warm compared to some cheaper smaller bluetooth speakers I've used. I really like the rubber push button to turn it on and off much better than the plastic toggle buttons used on other speakers. It feels more premium."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,Sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,4,"Great little speaker with awesome sound quality and range.  I had a smaller non-waterproof speaker that I liked due to size, but with rain and usage on my kayak I really need a waterproof speaker and this guy fits the bill and works as a solid camp speaker in the evenings as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,"This is a classic, high quality speaker with no frills. I don't worry about it getting wet at the beach, and it pairs quickly. I haven't tried the multiple speakers feature yet but that seems cool assuming you have several JBL speakers handy. Only thing I don't like is super minor, but the turning on and off sounds are oddly loud and don't match what the actual speaker volume is set for. Otherwise great, a bit heavy but no problem if you're just at home or driving to the beach/park."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Terrible battery life,4,"When I used my speaker I charged it for a full 12 hours the night before my daughter had a volleyball tournament and the next day she used it for about thirty minutes and it died. Charged it again for one of her practices died within thirty minutes as well I don't know if this is common or if it's my outlet but I won't ever buy from JBL ever again this was a waste of my money. Also, the Bluetooth was decent it would come unconnected and make my phone start to glitch. Even when it wasn't connected to the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My favorite speaker,5,"This was the 4th JBL Flip I've purchased.  One was a gift, but the other three live in my house. It may not be the most powerful portable speaker ever made, but it sounds great, travels easily, holds a charge for long enough to last through two consecutive nights of bonfires and brews, and the pairing process is super easy, too. What's not to love?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Gave this to my husband for Christmas.  He use it every day.  Charge last for 15 hours. My sister and  niece ordered them to.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A great buy... for the right price.,5,"I got this JBL Flip 4 open box, and if I paid full price, I wouldn't have rated it so highly. However, with the discount, this is one of the best options available right now.Battery life is very good. I don't find myself charging this often, but on the occasion I have to, it's back to full capacity quickly.The sound itself is also great. However, I have found that the quality of the sound worsens at very low volumes. You'd probably be just as well off to play music through your phone speakers if you plan on using this thing to quietly play music.In conclusion, if you find a Flip 4 on discount, buy with confidence. It has served me well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful speaker in a little package.,5,"I bought this speaker as a replacement for a speaker included in a video package.  The video package is for projecting images from inside a window for holiday displays.  The included speaker had a short battery life with little volume.  The JBL Flip 4 proved to be just the ticket.  Its battery life was great, lasted the entire evening with plenty left.  The volume was more than enough for people walking by to hear it plainly even though plenty of trick or treaters were yelling as they walked by.  And I didn't have the volume up to its maximum.  With its small size, I was able to hide it in a bush outside the window without being seen.  I look forward to finding more applications to use the JBL Flip 4.  A great value."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip4 Rocks,5,I purchased this after my Bose speaker that I had for 8 years died. I was really amazed at the sound quality that this speaker has. The connectivity to Bluetooth is seamless and easy. Battery life is pretty good compared to other speakers. A added bonus is that you can purchase other speakers and connect them together for a louder sound. I highly recommend this  product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker when not Paired,4,"We bought a second speaker to connect with our first one that we have loved. The new speaker works great, but once they are connected, the song will skip every few minutes. When not connected, both speakers work great. Still happy with our purchase, just wish there wasn’t skipping. Could just be the speakers getting used to being connected so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money!,5,I love this speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Sound,5,You get what you pay for...  The sound from this is amazing.  Deep bass.  Rich Treble.  Very convenient and sturdy.  Would absolutely suggest this as a purchse.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent value and long battery life!,4,Bought this for my wife to listen to around the house. Borrowed it a couple of times for my own use. Good value for the price. Sound is very good. Battery life is excellent. Easy to connect bluetooth.Nits are that the associated app has little functionality and that we cannot control music from it (volume or advance).
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,"Very picky life-long professional musician here. I can vouch for this thing. Totally worth the money. Battery life was especially impressive, in my experience. Zero BT connectivity issues between multiple devices (including Apple and Android phones, old and new)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom boom boom,5,These speaker is amazing for the price you don't only get quality but you get payability. This speaker is small but loud and sounds like a full blown large speaker or subwoofer. The battery has lasted me more and a day at work where I work as a Montessori teacher to toddlers so needless to say we are listening to and singing with music all day long.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL delivers excellent quality,5,"This is an excellent “on the go” speaker.Sound is crystal clear, and clean. The low end is the only drawback if you’re for more Bass, and not expected in such a compact system."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would buy again.,5,"This is by far the best ""bang for your buck"" speaker. Sound quality is excellent and is compact enough to take anywhere. Highs are crisp and clear and lows come through smooth and steady. Connected quickly with zero lag playing along with video. Battery was as advertised if not better. I used it three days moderately before recharge. I plan on picking up a few more to link together."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for summer time,5,"I bought one of these as a christmas gift and one year later, asked for it for myself for christmas! The sound quality is great, the battery seem to last forever and the connectivity is fast and easy. My favorite part, though, is that it's waterproof! I love taking it to the pool and not having to get out and dry off my hands, find my phone, etc. just to change the song. It's great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for outdoor workouts,5,"This is my second JBL flip 4.  They may have a battery life expectancy of 2-3 years.  I am a mobile fitness trainer and use mine like crazy.  After 2-3 years, I was only getting through 1-2 workouts before I needed to recharge the battery.  Whereas I can usually go several days on one charge.  This puts out great sound for an outdoor workout without being offensive to others at an area park not involved with the workout.  And waterproof is a great added bonus for trips to the beach or if the rain sets in"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound and perfect for active persons and water exposure.,5,"ok I have 2 boys and a husband who loves music. We have been through our fair share of portable speakers. I even just in the last year purchased a small portable Bose (the small squarish one) and this speaker completely blows it away.This is actually our 2nd time to buy this one. The first one was for my son, and this one was for me. You can pair the 2 together and get great surround sound, they are handy by the pool, or water and seriously, they sound AMAZING!I was hesitant to get this as I did buy a bose less than a yr ago, but when I left it at work and borrowed my sons, I couldnt argue that this speaker far surpasses the one I had and it was slightly cheaper, My bose was 100 and this one was 79."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice,4,"i like it, only issue is that the battery dies somewhat fast. if you drive an older car like me and can't set up an aux of any kind and you want to use this as your main speaker, know it will die within 10-12 hours. beyond that, this is a phenomenal speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!!,5,"I bought this for Father’s Day for my husband because he likes to play music when he’s out in the hot tub. It hangs easily on the shade umbrella and we don’t have to worry about the kids splashing it. I was amazed by the sound quality, including the bass!  As a bass player myself, this speaker does justice to my people!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,It's small but packs an audible punch. Glad I bought it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bad product,4,Brought this device as a birthday gift for my niece. The unit stopped working after three months.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best yet,5,Great bass. Clear sound without distortion. Bluetooth range is 5 stars.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its JBL of course its good. UPDATED MAR/16/2021,3,"This was probably the best thing I've gotten off Amazon in awhile if I could give it 10 stars I would. Its JBL I knew it was gonna be worth it ive had JBL subs in my car and they were awesome aswell yea I price is a little high but your 100% getting what you pay for high price for explanatory products. UPDATE Wednesday March 17th 2021 dude I've had this thing for awhile and omfg as you can see from my old post I loved it. NOW the second time taking it into the shower it won't turn back on. I seen a post from a guy who said he got one for his dad but it was refurbished and didn't have the water rubber seals, im not that smart so idk what I'm looking for, I also bought mine brand new, so yo hear that mine could have been short cutted pisses me off, I love this flip 4 so much that unfortunately if I can't get it running again. I'm gonna buy another and just not get it wet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My son LOVES this!,5,Got this as a gift for my son and haven't heard a complaint. Great sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Proved me wrong, I love it!",5,Wonderful sound and bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this Bluetooth speaker and forget the rest!,5,"Incredible sounding Bluetooth speaker! Bought a 2nd to pair with it and never looked back. I blast them at the post office I work at when I’m sorting mail and packages and this thing(times 2) fills the space with such depth and clarity I’m amazed! Playing at 50% volume and they last a long long long time, playing at 100% and they last longer than expected. Worth every penny! Times 2!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker,5,"I have had 3 speakers, one stopped charging the other the battery life was horrible and had trouble connecting. This JBL speaker quality is so far above the the previous two speakers. The volume and quality sound are incredible. The charge time is minimal, and the battery life is outstanding. I bought a second speaker for my daughter. I use mine golfing, out on the boat, sitting around the fire, ice fishing, virtually anywhere. I recommend this speaker to anyone that asks."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Surprisingly good sound, especially with Viper4Windows",4,"Out of the box, this speaker has decent sound: good bass for its size (not super powerful, but at you can tell what the bass line's doing). However, it sounds muffled, and of course the fact that its twin speakers are right next to each other doesn't do much for stereo separation or imaging. Comes with the territory of speakers this small, obviously. Fortunately, there's Viper4Windows or Viper4Android, free sound enhancers for PCs and Android phones. Viper's clarity effect deals nicely with the muffliness, and the 3D surround function (field surround on Android) adds some much-needed air. It's still not really compelling stereo, but it makes the listening more enjoyable, at least at close range (like at a desk).Speaker badly needs option to disable powerup/powerdown/bluetooth connect sound effects, and an option to stay powered on when plugged into USB power."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL never disappoints,5,Sound quality is amazing and I love the bass. The Bluetooth connects immediately when the device is turned on.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good overall device,5,"For the cost and included features, this device was well worth the money spent. I have not tested it’s water resistance but I would imagine it holds up as advertised"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will not pair with JBL flip 5,2,Compared to the JBL Flip 5 is inferior in sound quality.  If you plan on adding speakers know that the Flip 5 does not pair with this.  GOD bless
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy buena,5,Excelente
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Sound!,5,"This is the second speaker that I know own. I loved the first one so much that I had to get another so I can link them and listen in multiple rooms at the same time. The lows, mids, and highs coming from this little speaker are the best that I have found in a portable bluetooth speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,4,"This is my second Flip 4, I bought the second after getting such great use from the first. Good sound that rivals or exceeds Bose for 1/3 of the cost.Battery life is excellent.With 2 of them now I pair the 2 together for exceptional sound coverage."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and portability,5,"Just what I needed for an outdoor patio speaker. Great sound, easy to connect and good battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is my second one,5,"The sound quality is great for this little speaker.  It connects easily to our phones as well as our record player.  We enjoy the simplicity of it and the size too.  Small enough to throw in your bag while hiking, and loud enough to hear it while outside.  Overall we're happy with the product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Excellent sound, build, battery and price from a reputable company",5,"I bought this unit in discount from the treasure truck. For the price the sound quality, battery life and overall build quality of the Unit is fantastic.  I own a bose soundlink Mini and the bass is a bit better on that unit but it doesn’t match the JBL in overall flexibility and especially battery life.  I also found myself not wanting to bring the Bose places because it’s a bit more fragile.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking to have a compact speaker under $100 that you can just turn on and forget about."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","On its own it's great, if you want it doubled it sucks. Read below",4,"I originally bought this speaker to connect with another JBL Bluetooth speaker, the charge4.Unfortunately, the app on your phone that you need to connect the two to put on either stereo or party mode is pretty much worthless.the speaker itself works great, don't get me wrong. The problem is the two speakers working together do not work together. One cuts out, or the other cuts out.  Tried troubleshooting it, tried fixing the situation with multiple ways and nothing works. It's the app that JBL puts out, it just sucks.so if you're buying this speaker as a standalone it works great if you're buying it to connect with another JBL product well don't waste your money go with a different brand."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",hands free,5,i use it at work and in the car (hands free)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love da boom.,5,"Great size and dynamic sounds for a small portable speaker. I’m a Bose guy, but I give it up to JBL, this $100 dollar speak beats the Bose Bluetooth speak I bought at Costco for $150."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Received a Brick - AMAZON fixed the problem for me - LOVE JBL Flip 4,5,Well I received a dud. It won't start or power on straight out of the box. I've started a return immediately and Amazon is typically great about defective returns. But this was disappointing as I wanted to use it this holiday weekend. So in the spirit of transparency- I've ordered another one to arrive in two days. Will do another review when I receive the new one. Charging this one and there's no lights or power. Used a different cord from one included in case it was the power cord and no dice. So it's definitely the unit. I bought the black one as the blue one was backordered.UPDATE: Amazon sent me another JBL right out in the mail. Got it for the weekend and I LOVE this JBL. Sound is amazing. Waterproof is awesome. The only feature it's missing - is the ability to float. I've since bought 3 more of these.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It sounds good and it is really good,5,I like the sound quality of the jbl flip 4 wireless speaker and it is great product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Sound!,5,"I’ve had other speakers before that we’re not at all good sound. I bought this cause it was JBL and I’ve had things that I’ve liked made by them before. I liked the sound so much that when my daughter talked about getting something like it, I ordered another one and had it sent to her and her husband. They love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,"My family loves it, perfect for home P.E work outs and out door gardening. Its perfect for bluetooth laptops with poor sound quality making movie watching more enjoyable ?. Only problem is the case. The outside is magnetic. LIFT THE TAB, DONT PULL IT. I had no idea the box was magnetic and thus the speaker fell out of its box, could have damaged it...."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,4,"Has really clear, great sound. The battery is picky- sometimes it will stay charged for days (a few hours/day) and other times I charge it fully and it lasts half the time. It charges rather quick so this isn't a huge downfall.  I do wish it had an aux input."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,4,"Very crisp sound, good battery. Works great when paired with other JBL speakers. I have a charge 4 and 2 flips and it’s great for the backyard, by the pool."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little speaker but amazing quality,5,Small speaker but it's a LOUD little thing & battery last for quite some time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So glad I ordered this!,5,Great sound! It's easy to take on vacation or on my boat.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One of the best,4,"This is one of the best bluetooth speakers anyone can get right now for the price. The built quality, overall sound, bass and bluetooth connectivity is top notch. The only issue I had was the battery life. I've been using this speaker for almost a year now and when I'm listening to music at full blast, it only lasts me about two hours. It was very easy to notice the difference from the first time I bought it vs now. If JBL works to master the battery life usage, I believe they could create the ultimate bluetooth speaker (s), if they already haven't yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best in category,5,"This speaker is not the smallest but the sound is good. The sound is not as clear as in a good stereo system but I did not expect it from a small single speaker. Nevertheless, the sound is good. It is warm and soft. I preferred it over UE that sounded more spacial and background. The base is not as low as I would like.It is easy to join 2 speakers into a stereo.I think that at the moment this speaker is the best portable bluetooth speaker. Maybe Sonos is better but they start at $400."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",one of the most flawless pieces of technology i ever bought,5,this is by far one of the most flawless pieces of technology i’ve ever bought. i love this thing. i’m coming back to this page a year after i bought it to remark on how good of a product it is. just a delight to use. bravo to the people who built it. sounds incredible. the side woofers are amazing. so portable. the industrial design is slick. every part of it feels like quality. they really nailed it. the only regret with this thing is when i don’t have it with me
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing product!!,5,"First 'played' with one of these speakers when my girlfriend's son visited. . . . then left his Flip 4 speaker at our house!  I started playing around with it: paired it to my I-phone. . . . and Whoa!!  I was blown away by the amazing fidelity, and presence of the sounds!  Extremely solid construction, and water proof as well!  I perform live music with students, and plan on using this great speaker to share pre-recorded songs, and background music for movement activities.JBL has always been one of the top audio manufacturers, and has again hit a 'home run' with this new device!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Over all pretty happy with it,3,I ordered two. They connect to each other easily and sound great. One does not want to charge though. Only works if it is plugged in and neither of them have a very good battery life. Definitely does not stay charged for 12 hours. Closer to two hours. But they are nice and sound good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Gift,5,"Gave to my brother for xmas and so far the speaker has connected fast, very loud even louder than our TV. Feel it's a good purchase for the price, will update if anything happens down the line."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound! #JBL,5,Awesome sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What can I say it's a jbo great product,4,Love the product nothing bad to say
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loved it and still do.,5,"Love this speaker. My favorite wireless speaker I've ever purchased. Crisp uppers, clear mids, and booming bass. Not to mention when paired with a travel case it is an amazing travel speaker. I always have the travel case latched to my travel backpack so its a zip up away for a trip or going out. Its a very sturdy speaker in regards to water and dropping. I haven't tested this but it is evidently water proof. It has a long battery life too. I can listen for a few hours and see now drop in its 4 or 5 battery level indicators. From what Ive read, the only speaker I would look at instead of this is its practically identical Charge 3 or 4? I guess its an even more powerful version of this speaker. Which is surprising because this thing is amazing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to pair with beautiful sound,5,I wanted to try something a little different in a bluetooth speaker. I'm a big Bose fan but my Bose color is a few years old and pretty banged up. The battery isn't holding a charge very long anymore so I decided a new speaker was in my future. I chose the JBL Flip 4 and I'm very pleased with my purchase. It pairs easily to my phone ( iPhone 8 ) and the battery life is fantastic. The sound is just as good if not a touch better than the Color. It is not meant to fill the room but it is very enjoyable to listen to. I'm very pleased with my choice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good but limited functionality.,3,"The most annoying thing about this speaker is the lack of track advance (at least) and fast forward/rewind buttons. The much cheaper Oontz speaker that this replaced had that functionality and sounded nearly as good.The JBL speaker wins in that it looks good, is very water resistant so we can use it near/in water without worry, and it really does sound great.The JBL speaker loses in that there is virtually no information on how to use the various bits of functionality that it has. There is an app that needs to be installed to ""unlock"" some of the advertised features too, which is annoying that it's not made clear up front. JBLconnect works ok but it's sort of ""randomly push and hold buttons until everything is connected and hope that some other random bluetooth device doesn't connect first"".Oh and the app requires location data to run. It shuts down if you deny it. The fact that an app like this needs your location to enable features that are advertised for this unit without asterisks is sketchy as hell. Plus the app basically sucks. Reading up on other JBL speakers and the apps that they require... It's probably time to put JBL into the ""never buy this item because they force you to use software that they are not actually capable of creating."" In other words, this will be my last JBL purchase ever."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This thing ROCKS!,5,Recommended by a bestie and bought right away. Love the clear and crisp sound and much more power and volume than any other bluetooth speaker I've tried. This is the first time I've spent over 20 bucks on one and it's worth it. Just ordered a case to protect when not in use. Enjoying my new speaker quite a bit!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL switching to PartyBoost  buyer beware!,4,"Great little speaker but unfortunately JBL is switching away from connect+ (which this and most others have from JBL) to ""Party boost"" for connecting more than one speaker around the house or yard at the same time. JBL is making ALL their speakers obsolete with pairing to newer speakers. The flip 5 is only the current model that has jumped to part boost so far. The software is not fwd or backwards compatible so either stick with the older models or buy the newest ones..which haven't all come out yet. Really a let down. Terrible decision to not make them all talk together."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great,5,it's a jbl and it sounds like it should
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, lightweight yet sturdy, great battery life",4,"Really happy with this purchase. I live by myself, so I don't need a super fancy audio set up because I'm usually using headphones. That said, I wanted something I could use outside when I have friends over to grill in the summer. This has worked perfectly so far, the battery life is long, and the sound quality is stellar for its size. Really nicely balanced. An added benefit that I didn't anticipate is the fact that I can use it to listen to podcasts/audio books as I'm falling asleep and plug in my phone in another room entirely. (When I plug my phone in in my bedroom overnight, I end up wasting a bunch of time in the mornings.) The battery lasts for several nights this way. (I do use my sleep timer on 30 or 45 minutes.)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds good, but battery seems faulty In some",4,"I love the JBL Flip. This is my second Flip 4, the first one rattled after a hard fall, so I decided to get this to replace it. The speaker sounds great, and when they are new the battery life is good; however, this speaker was barely over a year old when the battery started to not hold a charge any longer. It would show that it was fully charged, but after about an hour of use it would die. It’s obviously an issue with the battery. I went ahead and just bought another one, but I feel like they should last longer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Great sound, battery lasts a very long time. I have one and bought one for my mom and aunt, both were very satisfied as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I like it !,5,"The sound of this little speaker is amazing! I listen to Spotify all day connecting my phone with this speaker via Bluetooth (which was as easy as turning on the speaker and selecting the speaker on my Bluetooth devices in my phone) It fills my studio with music without trouble. It has enough power to raise the volume to unnecessary loud levels. I also tested it as a speakerphone and calls were very clear and people listened to me clearly as well. On the down side, the cable it comes with is short (mostly for recharging the speaker than keeping it plugged). It doesn't come with a carrying case although the box is pretty fancy and could be kept as a case. The user manual comes in so many languages that it's hard to figure out but since I had other Bluetooth speakers before I knew what to do."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",been put thru the tests....,5,"Well i didn't have this for 3 hours when i dropped it in the mud. whiped off , fine. then maybe week later in straight down pour and came out fine. it is my garage speaker its been dropped,stepped on, black finger prints from dirt on it. It still great charge and the sound quality is great!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!!!,5,The speaker sounds really great!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the price !,4,"I had been eying this speaker for a while now and finally purchased it. The first time I bought it, it worked great, everything worked until I attempted to charge it. Apparently the port to charge it with was loose and I wasn’t able to use it, so I called Amazon Support (11/10 for service!), and they were able to connect me with a manufacturer to get me a replacement free of charge. I received the new one and I haven’t had any problems since! Great for just chilling in your room alone, with friends, get togethers, and more!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Buy!!,5,"This speaker is a great buy. The sound is clear and a lot louder than I thought. I can use it in the shower with no problems at all! It's really easy to use and comes in a box that I could keep as a case for it, there's even a place for the charger in the box."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect travel speaker,5,"This speaker has sufficient power and quality of sound for most occasion. It’s a small and water resistant package that makes it very convient for traveling, poolside afternoons and beach trips, or even dinner out on the patio with the fam.  Colors are fun too."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Portable, Easy to Use...I'm a Fan",5,"We used to have this big, clunky speaker 2-in-1 combo that had a detachable, portable speaker...and then the dog ate through the cord. RIP. The JBL Flip is a powerful little speaker that's great for toting around the house or outside or wherever you're listening to things. I has the sound output of a bigger speaker with convenience and portability. I can hear it playing from the other end of the house, and it seems to have decent range when connected to the phone. I can pretty much go anywhere in my house without it dropping or stuttering. It's easy to use and sync with devices, too, which can be a weak point with bluetooth-connected devices. I haven't paid enough attention to the battery life, but so far it seems pretty reasonable compared to my dearly-departed speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great bluetooth speaker, no regrets",5,"This speaker is awesome. It's my first JBL and I've had it for over a month now. Battery life is great, the sound is great even with heavy base. Music has a nice full sound and it can get very loud. I also  listen to a lot of audio books and this speaker makes it much easier to hear while moving from room to room and voices are not distorted. I love that there is the potential to sync with other JBL speakers.My one con isn't even a serious one. I don't think it has the connection range that I heard claimed on some YouTube reviews. I took my phone across the house (I live in small home so it wasn't that far) and the speaker cut out a bit.Very pleased with my purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for cycling,5,"Bought this due to the connect+ feature to connect with my teammates on bike rides - and because it was a great deal on Black Friday. I haven't used that feature yet as winter has stopped all of our team rides, but I've taken it out on my own several times and it is GREAT. The sound quality and volume have topped any of the several other speakers I've tried and it's gone through mud and slush with no difficulties. On top of that, the battery life is great - I use an old iPod Touch for music when I ride to avoid killing my phone battery and the speaker outlasts the iPod's battery life. Very excited to get lots of use on the trails without having to charge it every single time!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best blue tooth speak I've owed,5,"Awesome sound, size and shape.  Love this to put in drink holder of camp chair etc.  I've had cheaper speakers that sound as good but I think the difference in paying more is for the superior battery"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip 4,5,"Brought this for my wife and she immediately fell in love with it. Sound quality is equal to a small tv sound bar and rivals a boom box. It’s solidly built but not heavy or bulky, has a nice feel and the black is so sleet. Battery life is great, charged it once, she played music all day and into the night. We love it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound quality is AMAZING! Size is perfect! LOVE IT!,5,The sound quality is AMAZING! Size is perfect! LOVE IT!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Content,4,Love it... Just wish it came with a wall charger.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVEEEEEEEEE,5,"I love this speaker, I purchased a case which houses the USB cord. I use this speaker daily up to 8 hours a day and the sound is great! I've also put this speaker in bike water holder, perfect fit. You can connect other JBL speakers altogether, charge and play the speaker at the same time. It has also taken  a few dives with floating the Texas rivers and no need to put it in rice!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Delivers On Sound and Battery Life Quality,5,It’s become an extension of my phone.  Carry it everywhere inside and out to listen to my music.  Very quick to connect.  Great sound from a compact speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Terrific for Indoor Amplification,5,"This is a great speaker. It's portable, connects well to bluetooth, and lasts for days with a single charge. This version works best indoors (the audio tends to get drowned out by the wind), so if you're in the market for an outdoor speaker, I'd suggest getting the next model up. Again, the key feature of this model is its portability."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Cute, but too much bass",4,"Nice little speaker, but too much bass which is not adjustable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Sound In A Small Package,5,"I’ve owned one of the first generation flips for many years.  I have always been impressed with the sound produced by my older flip and the Flip 4 is just as impressive.I bought two so I could take advantage of the Connect+ features.  Then I decided I could replace an old set of Wireless party speakers I’ve had for several years with these, so I bought two more.  They sound terrific and fill my home and yard with clear deep music when I use them.Their small size, weight and clean lines make them easy to take with me or pack safely out of sight.I’m likely to buy more of these to fill more of my home with their impressive sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Easy to use, sound isn't impressive",4,"Physically the size and shape are good, although it is rounded on the bottom for some reason. Pairing was quick and easy with a Android phone. I am not impressed with the sound. I've been a JBL fan for years, but this speaker sounds mushy. No distinct highs and lows. Maybe it's the type of music I play on it(mostly rock), I don't know. It is definitely better than my phone speaker, but still far below even basic bookshelf speakers. On sound alone I'd give it a 3."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Who thought an Bright ORANGE charging cord was a good idea?,3,"The product is fine - but who thought that a bright orange charging cord was a good idea?  Seriously.  Unless your home is bright orange, you'll need to hide this when it is charging."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound in a small package,5,"I have been tired of the crappy sound coming from my phone, so I decided to try the flip and I love it. The sound is amazing, you can hear the bass notes as long as you understand that its not meant to be played at full volume. Crystal clear sound  at an affordable price. Worth the purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","JBL Flip 4, Black - Waterproof",5,Excellent sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof Excellent Sound!,5,"Great product, sounds amazing, and is definitely waterproof!  I take it out on my boat and have never been happier with the sound quality and peace of mind I get from knowing water won’t hurt it!  As long as you attach it to the boat or something that floats you have zero to worry about!Can use this version as a speaker phone as well. It’s not crystal clear, but it’s better than having to pick up your phone while driving a boat!10/10 would recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","High Quality, Low Quantity",3,"The JBL Flip 4 has great positives, but some noticeable negatives.- The sound quality is great, and volume is good for the price. I listen to music all over the map, from Metal to Rap and it does a solid job capturing all sounds.- Its super easy to connect to, and is very simple to set up. Pretty easy navigation.-The battery life is the kicker. It says 12 hours, but you may only get that with the lowest volume. If you want to blast music that has heavy base, its going to last you maybe 4 hours. As someone who works in the construction industry, I was looking for something that could last an entire work day. This speaker cannot. However, for the casual listener, this is a great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GET THE PROTECTION PLAN,4,PAY THE LITTLE BIT EXTRA FOR THE PROTECTION PLAN. I don't usually do reviews but the reviews helped me purchase this item. I would have given a 5 start if mine stayed working. It worked fine when I got it and I loved it!. It sat unused for the winter. the other day turned it on. It came on but the Bluetooth would not connect. I gooled it and it seems that happens a lot with these. But what they said to do didn't work. Then It would not come on unless I had it connected to power. Very frustrating!!!! Well I had purchased the 4 year Asurion Protection plan for around 11.00 and It was one of the easiest things I had ever done. They are sending me stuff to send it back and giving me a full refund.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Bluetooth speaker with microphone I've ever owned.  Quality sound!??,5,"So glad I bought this. Transitions smoothly between playing music and then acting as a speakerphone for a call. No one has ever complained that I ""have them on speakerphone"" when I'm using this, and that's saying a LOT. My boyfriend absolutely hates speakerphone, yet he doesn't mind this one.  Highly recpmmend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great performance,5,Impressive sound quality & volume. Excellent value. Highly recommended.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High quality little speaker!,5,"Significant upgrade from the Aomais Sport (which was also very good and cheap!) The bass and general sound quality is superb, for such a small speaker. It always picks up on the Bluetooth connection with my phone with no hassle. Long battery life: I listen for probably an hour or two every day, and I go several days in between charges. Controls are easy to use. I haven’t paired it with another JBL speaker yet, but I like that that is an option for a stereo or a synced multi-room experience. I’m glad I spent a few extra bucks for this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not totally waterproof but really a great speaker.,4,"The only reason I’m giving this four stars is the sound and connectivity is really good,  the only issue is the whole “ water proof” part of it?? What does this mean exactly? Yes it did take a drink in a river and now it won’t power up, yes it was submerged in water few a minute maybe. Be very careful that yours doesn’t take a dunk into the toilet or any water. Other than that it’s a great speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds really nice,5,It is a must have
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Big, Portable Sound",5,We love our JBLflip4. Very handy in our car on road trips. Volume buttons are self explanatory. Good high notes and great low notes. Perfect size for us. Great value.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice.,5,Delivers everything good in a Bluetooth speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",use as wired speaker,5,love this speaker.  nice sound quality.  use it for my phone and laptop.  i have a 3 foot  cable to connect  and this size is good.  battery life seems good.  i listen 1 hour or so per day..no issue with charge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound from Small device!,5,"I've only had 1 other cheap Bluetooth speaker, that i then attached to a Google Chromecast Audio  dongle, in the hopes that i could then purchase ANOTHER cheapy bluetooth speaker and ANOTHER Chromecast audio dongle in order to get crappy stereo sound.In the case with this JBL we cut out all the extra wires and setup for a very sleek , very small, yet very nice sounding speaker, that can eventually be linked with 100 other ""connect+"" devicesAlthough this will only work in Stereo mode with a 1X1 configuration, and ""party"" mode with 100 devices, i still find this very attractive.There are many videos comparing quality , size, ""water-proof-ness"" etc.. of the top Sony, vs Anker (budget) vs JBL, the sound quality in all of those makes this Flip 4 amazing, its clear, and warm and crisp.Would recommend"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love It,5,This every thing I expected and the red color is phenomenal.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than my mom's Bose,5,I was really surprised by the sound and bass that came from this speaker.  I didn't want to spend a lot on a Bose speaker. I didn't love the quality of my mother's Bose Bluetooth speaker anyway though its a few years old.  This was perfect. I highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life was great while it lasted.,3,I enjoyed this product the first few months. I ordered it 8/6/21 and I’ve noticed these past few days (written 11/28/2021) that the battery life has diminished. It used to be able to play for 12 hours straight and still have some life left in it but now I play music for 2 hours and it has a low battery despite being fully charged prior to use. I wish I bought a sound bar instead of this. Feels like a total waste of money. And I’ve owned it only for 4 months.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great!  Warning, keep it clean...",4,"I love this speaker!  My husband gave this to me as a gift for my birthday.  I take it everywhere and the color is super cute.  The outer portion is plastic except for the area that covers the speaker.  Unfortunately, we have 4 kids and someone's dirty hands (with brownie crumbs) touched it and it's very noticeable.  Still works great, of course!  If you have little ones or any person around you with potentially dirty hands, be warned.  Ha!  May want to get the black instead. :)If you appreciated this review and if you enjoy other great deals, you can follow me on IG @prettycheapmama!Happy shopping!Pretty Cheap Mama"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not as advertised !,3,My old JBL lasted 2 days on the job (16 hrs) - before recharge - this one died 3 days consecutively after only 5 hours !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bad for aux cable use,3,"When used with aux cable, the unit will automatically turn off if the music is too quiet.  This results in the beginning of songs being cut off or the song cutting out during a quiet part;  this is especially problematic with movies.  The rest of the functionality is ok, but I did not expect such a broken ""power saving"" feature..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blue tooth speakers with great sound,5,"I bought the larger version of this a couple years ago. Loved it so much I decided to buy the smaller version hoping the sound quality would be good. I love these little speakers!! They have great sound!! They are so easy to use, small and easy to pack in a purse and a great price too!! You won't be disappointed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,"I’ve had & used this little baby 6-8 months not. The sound is great even at higher volumes although I’ve never maxed it out. I hope it lasts at least a couple or few years. Otherwise, I’ll re-review it but I would buy this again it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the price!  Design could use a small tweak!,4,"Great sound!  I'm thrilled with the quality of the speakers and sound for the price.  I'm not an audiophile, just wanting some decent sound, and it certainly delivers that for me. I like the fact that I can take it around water and not worry so much.  Pros:  Looks and sounds great. Weight is heavy enough to make me think that it's well-made, and light enough to feel comfortably portable.  Cons:  I don't like it's complete cylindrical design because it rolls in such a way as to cause the power, volume, and connection ports to end up on the bottom (backside) out of easy reach.  But, it's not a deal breaker for me because I'm pleasantly satisfied with the other features.  It's just a small inconvenient annoyance. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,I love this bluetooth speaker. I use it for hours at a time. Battery holds up great. The sound is awesome.  I bought 2 more for my daughters. This will not disappoint you!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, solid Bluetooth connectivity and easy to set up",4,"This Bluetooth Speaker sounds great.  The Bluetooth connection is solid 10's of feet away from my iPhone.  The set up is easy, in spite of the unnecessarily complex instructions.  Instructions must have been written by a non-english speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker!,5,"This speaker is great! I also Have the Bose Sound Link. Both speakers are great. I think the Bose is more attractive and subtle but this one may take the lead in clearness and sound quality. If you are on the fence, buy it!!! You will not regret it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the sound,5,Sound is great. Nice clear full sound for various music genres. Battery life has been very good. It charges pretty fast and maintains a charge for hours. Very convenient speaker. Also has nice bass.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Loud, clear, durable",5,"This is the best Bluetooth speaker I've owned--and I've gone through many. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I listen to a lot of different kinds of media on this. Great for a variety of music (even bass which small speakers like this don't tend to do well with), podcasts, and movies on my computer. It's clear, never crackly, and I've never come close to maxing out the volume.Small enough to throw in a bag, and the battery life is so good that I sometimes forget to charge it for upwards of a week."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the speaker,5,Love the Bluetooth speaker sounds so good and really good quality it’s last long too
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blown away by the powerful sound,5,"Honestly I bought this as a Christmas gift for my partner and I was so jealous ?? The sound on this speaker is so powerful! I love the vibrant red although I wanted the black one.. it’s portable, charges quickly and connects with all tablets computer and phones easily. This was one of the best speakers I’ve ever purchased.. it’s definitely worth every penny! I would advise getting a case for it especially if you work in a hands on field. It can get dirty, and it’s not a good look on the bright red. Otherwise it’s amazing! JBL is the best!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life,3,When it is plugged in it works great. It does not keep a charge at all.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for the value.,5,"Love this speaker. I’m not a speaker enthusiast. If you want something that is clear and has good volume output, get this. I use it for when I’m cleaning around the house, cooking, or working outside in the yard or on my vehicle. Holds a charge well and lasts decently long depending on how loud you play music. I have not tested out the waterproof feature other than it was outside during a light rain. Do not get white unless you feel like you can keep it clean and grease free. That was my only mistake."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it.,5,"My son had bought one of these little speakers and he loves it. Well I decided to purchase one and I am very happy. For a small speaker it has great sound. I only listen to jazz and I never listen to loud music. My wife loves Motown, that's what we grew up on. Well she listens to Motown when she does her daily workouts and she decided to crane up the sound. This little speaker even sounds good when the volume is all the way up. Another plus is the ability to hold a charge and it's waterproof. We took this out on our canoe and it was playing for over 4 hours, that evening I listen to it for another 5 hours and it was still going strong."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for Work,4,I got this for my boyfriend for work. He works with fiber optics in his truck or sometimes outside and he uses it everyday. He said the quality and battery life are 4 stars. I’d say thats pretty good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Brand new and works like a charm.,5,"I already had a JBL flip 4, and I wanted another one for my work truck, because the Flip 5's don't have a built in mic for answering calls. This one works great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ultra sound *,5,"My Treblab  HD7 recently quit on me and purchased the JBL  flip 4  as the replacement.Even though it looks very similar to the Treblab, it is a totally different sound box and I meanfar superior in all aspects.  If you are in the search for a speaker as such, I would highly recommendthis model. Very happy with purchase - puts the Treblab to shame......"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive!!,5,"Purchased this speaker to play music when we’re entertaining guests on our deck or in the pool. Took it out of the box, tuned it on, connected it to my iPad, and played the first song I had on my playlist. Sound quality is AMAZING!! It’s not fully charged when it arrives so I can’t comment on the battery life. It’s sturdy, easy to figure out even without reading the instructions, and comes neatly packaged in a reusable magnetic box. I can’t wait to use it more!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW!!!,5,I bought the portable JBL Flip 4 for my patio rather than mounting outdoor speakers.  It's perfect!  The sound has great clarity and amazing sound for its size!!  I typically only need to have the volume set at 40-50% which greatly extends the battery.  I absolutely love this speaker!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good price , amazing sound, and delivered within 4 days !",5,"JBL-4 has an amazing sound . I bought one 3 years ago, and tried changing the battery disastrously.  The cost of new JBL-4s through this vendor was more reasonable compared to Target, Walmart and Best Buy!  I’m  so content with this model that I don’t really need to spend extra bucks to get the latest ;  I did , however buy two of the JBL-4s ; one for me to play in my backyard and one for my teenage music -loving son .  I don’t like to share !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Unit,4,"Bought this as a dual purpose computer and on the go unit. It sounds great hooked up to my computer, I did figure out that if you power it via plug and not usb it stays connected. Via usb it drops after 30 minutes if plugged in."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Sound and Pairs with Multi Devices,5,"I got this speaker cause my coworkers had Jbl Flip 4 and 5. So I got the 4 and I love the pattern. My other speaker which was Altec Lansing could not pair with my computer when it paired with my phone but this speaker you can pair with multi devices. Recommend seriously, no cap."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ish bangs,5,"Just got this guy today, so giving a review based on initial impressions. Will update if there are any issues. Perfect size. Compact enough to be thrown in a bag or even carried in hand, but big enough to have some solid base and sound. It feels sturdy and had some nice packaging.  It connected with my phone and laptop pretty much instantly. None of that bluetooth bs. So far I'm very happy with it. My only gripe is that it only comes with a charging wire and not the plug."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super Sound,5,I was very surprised by the sound quality. I definitely recommend this bluetooth speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not the sound quality I expected,3,"I decided to go cheaper and relied on the JBL brand. Sound is OK, but not nearly as good as the UE Boom 2 I have."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,When i buy something i always focus on price/quality combination. In this case for a speaker under $100!!!!!! No question asked.Of course if you want to run a party for 100 people on your 2 acre back yard you need something stronger but obviously get ready at least $300.

 One of the best speakers you can buy. FW update gives you a little more bass. The size the sound the speakerphone everything is great on this speaker. This is my 5th Flip 4. Rather have this than a Flip 5. Looks great in white. Still the champ in this size and category. Crisp clear and a deep rich bass for this size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,"This is portable, light weight, with a full sound. I use it every day at work and at home."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",... this speaker for about two months now and I love it. I can hang it from a tree ...,5,"I've been using this speaker for about two months now and I love it.  I can hang it from a tree during a party and it fills the back yard pretty well.  I can take it out on the water and it can fall into the water and I don't have to worry about it.  I even started leaving it in my office to charge because the sound and bass are really nice.  Not enough to blow away your home theatre speakers but really surprising for this things size and price.To top this all off, battery life is fantastic!  I've never had an instance where I've run out of battery life or even had to worry about that.  I've left it on during parties for more then 8 hours without issue.Overall an amazing speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice portable take with you everywhere speaker,5,"Same day shipping.  Have only used once.  The sound quality is great & the speaker projects well outdoors despite it's size.  My concern, based on other reviews, is how much play time I get between charges - only time will tell.  I'll edit & update this review as necessary."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A great small speaker...better than expected for it's size...,5,"I have two Charge 3 units with which I have been very pleased.  I purchased the Flip 4 for a smaller space, but was surprised to find that it sounds very nearly the same.  This is a fine small easy to tote Bluetooth speaker.  It's a good value and covers the frequency spectrum uniformly.  It is neither peaky nor strident.  It sounds about as good as a speaker this size can possibly sound.  I doubt I'll be testing the waterproof characteristics of it any time soon...under water is not my preferred listening venue.  I bought the white one (my Charge 3's are black) and the unit ""looks"" great.  I've used JBL for over 50 years (before Harman Kardon got in the act) and it is brand worthy of my trust."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding,5,Sound quality is off the chain for such a small speaker! We LOVE IT ! Now my 16 year old wants one. My mom got this same one as a gift. I was so impressed I bought it for my boyfriend and we can both enjoy it! It’s a win win!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Speaker,5,"I spent lots of time reading reviews and weighing the pros and cons of the $100 Bluetooth speakers market. I settled on the JBL Flip 4 in early summer, and it was a great decision! Like stated in the product description the battery life is phenomenal. I generally don't listen on more than half volume and I'll go weeks without charging. The design is sleek and functional, and its small size means you can bring it everywhere and put it anywhere. The sound is very good in all varieties of of music, I listen to rap, country, rock, jazz, big band, choir, really anything sounds great. I really like the red color, it pops in every environment so you won't forget it on the beach or on a rock by your camp fire. Fantastic speaker for its price and size!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid Speaker,5,"I only use this speaker while I’m in the shower. I never tested the waterproof capabilities though and I don’t plan too. Sound is good considering the size, Bass is there but about what you’d expect from a speaker this size. Battery life hasn’t irritated me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life sucks,2,"Bought 2 pcs (one for my bro as a present) in 2018. We were completely satisfied by speaker's quality, but, after 3 years both of units dropped their battey life suddenly, means, after being fully charged after 1/2 hour of usage it just shuts down. Once plugged to recharge, almost immediately shows full charge, but then again, all that repeats... Our time of enjoying the product appeared to be very short."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,"This thing is great. I owned the bigger size, but bought the small one for travel. Love it. Plenty loud for your hotel room or balcony or beach or pool without being too annoying to others. Sound quality is fantastic. I haven’t tried to dunk it under water or anything. Battery will last several hours"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE THIS!,5,"This speaker sounds awesom and for something so small I was very pleased. It arrived quickly, and was really easy to pair to my phone. I will be getting the larger size soon so I can pair it with my TV and when you have 2 of the same brand you can pair the 2 of them."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for what it is,5,"I'm not a sound buff who sits in a chair savoring the true reproduction of a musical sound track, I just want something to push out a decent sound without distortion while I'm working in my workshop. This does a great job. The sound is full and satisfying. It's easily portable with several hours' battery life. I usually run it from my mobile phone, and the bluetooth connection is dead easy. You can control the volume on either the speaker or the phone.  I like that when a phone call comes in the music is muted, but I don't love that the phone call sound comes through the JBL device. I hope there's a simple way to prevent this, I just haven't bothered to look. All round, it's a great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Look no further than JBL!,5,"I'm convinced that JBL produces the BEST portable/compact Bluetooth speakers ever!  The sound quality is AWESOME for such a low price.  I'm using this for my jet ski and it really fits well.  This speaker is good for multiple rugged outdoor conditions.  If it were possible on Amazon, I'd rate it with 17 stars."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It has a short, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't",3,"I bought this back in January, and I didn't love it even at first. The base is way too basey, and the volume was super lacking. But after a couple of months, it started shorting out. I'd be listening to a program, and it would cut out. The only way to fix it was to turn the thing off and re-start it, and there was still no guarantee that it would work. Now, 8 months later, all of these issues seem to have increased. The base drowns out the treble to the point I have a hard time making out words in songs, the volume is lower than at first, and it shorts out all the time now. Definitely a lemon."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Amazing Quality, Durable Design, Absolutely Perfect.",5,"Unbelievable sound quality in a super durable device. I've been a Bose customer exclusively for many years, however, after replacing my Colorwave speaker for the 3rd time, I decided to venture out and give JBL a shot. I'm honestly only disappointed I didn't make this move sooner. Simply cannot go wrong with this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, easy set up, extremely portable",5,"I've bought a couple of these JBL speakers, which are not the cheapest of their category, but seem to have far superior sound to the others I've heard. It 's handsome and durable little product which paired easily via BlueTooth to my computer. No batteries -- it's charged via USB cable. I haven't tried it underwater, but seems fine on land."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable speaker with great color,5,"I ordered the teal version for my wife as a mother's day gift because it's her favorite color and this speaker had generally favorable reviews.  A lot of other portable speakers have unattractive designs or color options, but this hits the mark.  Pairing via bluetooth was easy on an iPhone XR and Android phone.  I have not tested the app, but it's not needed unless you want more advanced options or pairing multiple speakers.  Speaking of, this speaker has the ability to connect to other JBL speakers to create a sort of surround sound environment.I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for one.  Charges via micro usb and holds a charge for a long time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works every time,4,"This is the best blue tooth speaker I’ve had. It’s my forth try. What I love is that it connects every time, I never have to fight with it like I did with the bose.  I was a little tossed up about the sound quality, this has more percussion than the bose but the bose has a fuller mid-range. I decided to go for the percussion because it works & for exercise percussion may be more important anyway. I sure wish I could marry the 2 for sound purposes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awsome,5,"My roommate had one and it kicks ASx!! So good I had to get my own, You should too. Big sound!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",wonderful,5,For about the size of a soda can you can have amazing sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's worth it!,5,I bought it for my son 15yo for his soccer self-practice. He and his friends loves that speaker! I thought it is little expensive but sound quality is awesome and battery life is quite good! One of the best stuff I bought it for him!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Gift for dad. Decent speaker with decent battery and sound not super loud but a good loud speaker.,4,Great for the price. 5 stars is a high bar. So I give it 4
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use,5,Use for music outside
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's OK,4,"The sound is really good. But the sound doesn't match up with the lips when you're using bluetooth... which is more of a bluetooth problem overall. If I had known I would've tried to get an RF wireless speaker.Also, the bass is so loud you have to turn it off to listen to movies. But it won't turn the bass off from the PC it has to be turned off from the speaker which requires you to hold the bluetooth and lower volume button at the same time for like 15-20 seconds. Which is a pain in the ass and something the instruction booklet didn't tell you about.Besides that, it sounds pretty darn good. The battery lasts a long, long time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Not bad, but far from perfect",4,Optimum battery life only lasted about 3 months. It’s already beginning to struggle holding a charge. One of the cones broke within three days. The speakers cannot handle heavy bass.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great gift and fantastic sound,5,I bought this JBL because my son has the upgraded version.  I LOVED the sound quality from that do when my husband said he wanted one like his but smaller. I purchased this and a case to protect it. He was very happy. Just what he wanted.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,5,Great value
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Such a great speaker, we bought a second one!",5,"We purchased one after seeing positive references to the Flip 4 on every other bluetooth speaker review.  We were so impressed with the Flip 4, we bought a second one.Bottom Line:  A GREAT speaker.  Highly recommend.The sound quality is superb (inside and outside), volume is excellent, Battery lasts, and the build is outstanding.Love that it's water-, dust-, sand- proof and can be washed with some dish soap.Ended up buying a second one - and while the party/stereo feature of two sounds even better - a single one sounds nearly as good as having the two.We also have a Sonos Play 1 - and the Flip 4 matches (and may exceed) the sound quality of the Sonos.Overall, a GREAT speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's great sound,5,Best sound for size
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound is great! The two-device system is flawed however,4,"The sound is great!  The two-device system is flawed however.  If my wife is using the speaker, and I am in the house and get a text message, then my phone overrides hers on the speaker.  So one of the phones has to be totally disconnected from the speaker or you end up with a battle of phones.And it doesn't have to be that way.  I have a set of inexpensive bluetooth headphones that handles two devices flawlessly - on those headphones 2 devices can be paired to it at once, and the 2nd NEVER overrides the first.  If I stop the music on the first device, then sound from second can come through.JBL, a leader in audio, should have figured this out already."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Portable, waterproof & amazing sound volume!!!",5,"I play music in the morning for students entering the building, it slips right into my pocket and blasts like I'm at a concert!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doesn't work anymore,2,This worked great for a few years but has since stopped working and is now nothing more than a paper weight. :(
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blast Your Doors Off!!!,5,"This blue-tooth speaker blew ALL my teeth off. Very powerful, although my Dentist is quite upset. Don’t let them tell you size matters. This speaker is so powerful, I plan to use the sonic blast to blow open the Safe door on my best Vegas-Casino heist."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cute but loud!,5,"This thing is the bomb! I contemplated buying a small speaker for long time and I am glad that I went with this when I finally decided to pull the trigger. Killer quality and has a little subwoofer built in! Also, I really love the outside pattern - it sets my apart from all my friend's."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",After using for 2 months not hold the charge,3,Sounds is good but not hold the charge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,"Its a good speaker for sure. The Bluetooth is great, you don't have to reconnect every time, just turn it on and hit play. You can Bluetooth phone calls/talk thru it which i like a lot. The down side is its not a 12 hour battery. Mine last 8 jors max and when its cold it only last about 4 hours . Other than the battery life in happy with it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blech,2,"Bottom line is it does not sound good. There is no EQ, and the crossover is very poorly tuned. Great if all you want is 1k-4k. Bass & low mids are non-existent. Distorts at low volume. Maybe if you bought a subwoofer, too. Very disappointed, as I chose JBL due to satisfaction with past products. Super non-helpful documentation and product support online."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfied!,5,"Great Great speaker. Connects very fast, superb sound quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product! Couldn't be more impressed.,5,"I could not be more impressed with this product. The sound quality is excellent and the sound levels are impressive. Its so easy to pair with your phone and best part is, IT CAME CHARGED. JBL is doing it right!UPDATE: Still so so happy with this speaker and the battery lasts a very long time, I have listened for 12+ hours at times and the battery still has a fourth charge. And the LED battery life indicators are a big help for when you need to see how much power it has left. The amazing sound of these is impressive. And I have since bought another for a friend because I was so impressed with it. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a good reliable Bluetooth Speaker. Cost 100, would  definitely buy even if it was 200"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Tough, Waterproof, Compact, Sounds Good, Perfect in the golf cart.",5,"Should have written a review of this months ago. I bought this because it was water proof and I like to have it with me on the golf course. It is well made and tough and the sound quality and amplification is great. Fits in the cup holder of a golf cart. Battery lasts at least 5 hours with conituing play. I liked the one I bought for my golf bag so much I bought another one for my office. My friends like it so much 5 of them have bought one for themselves. JBL has always been recognized as a quality speaker manufacture, this lives up to the legend. As good as a Bose mini ant less than half the price. You will not be disappointed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this speaker,5,"It is sturdy, loud, and doesn't complain when the battery is low, it just has that light. That red light that says ""Hey; charge me, man. I'm down in volts.""Great speaker, and that it connects to others like it is way more fun that running cables.Me human that can typing this review."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great choice and great investment,5,"It’s a very easy to use Bluetooth speaker and I’ve been using it for a week now almost everyday. It’s high quality and loud one (not super loud but good enough), connects quickly to my phone. Updating its firmware took 30mins but I don’t mind cause you don’t need to update it regularly. Enables you to talk through it and you can also connect it to another JBL speaker and sync them to play at the same time. Overall 5/5"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Quality for a decent price!,5,"I bought this speaker twice now. One for myself, and most recently as a gift. it is well loved!Primarily use it on our kayaks or by the pool. the splashproof feature is what sold me on it.the Bluetooth connection is incredible! I can leave my phone on the charger in my house and it easily reaches to the pool deck without interferene.sound is great quality for such a small speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is our second one.,5,We temporarily left one in a vehicle being repaired.. couldn't live without this awesome speaker so we knew we could have it next day-- just with a click we happily own and use two. One for the pool and one for the bbq ????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s best,5,It’s alr
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,I bought this to take out on my small boat so we could have some music and it's great because it's waterproof so I don't have to worry about water spray and it gets pretty loud and sounds clear. The battery life is great it lasts me all day depending if it's used continually or not and if using blue tooth or aux cord.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful sound in a small device,5,Love the sound quality and style. Wish the battery lasted longer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Calidad del sonido y facilidad en el manejo,5,EL EQUIPO SOBREPASO MIS ESPECTATIVAS EXCELENTE ADQUISICION
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for my work van.,5,"Nice little speaker. Bought for my work van so I can play music and podcasts from my phone. Works good. Super easy to connect and battery life has been great. Sound quality is good but could use more bass. If it is not loud enough there is a ""high frequency mode"" to boost the volume a little."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ok speaker but terrible battery life,3,"I am a restaurant manager with stagehand and sound engineering experience. This speaker is a good speaker if you play music at 75% volume your less. When working in a loud restaurant sometimes it needs to be turned up louder and this speaker doesn’t get as loins as some of the others I’ve had so at times, depending on the kitchen, it was too faint to really enjoy.BATTERY LIFE: is a huge issue. Incase you don’t know, the higher the volume the more power the speaker consumes. I had about 30% battery, I plugged it in to the wall and after about 30 min to an hour it was dead even though it was plugged in.The speaker can use more power than what the charger can deliver. On top of that it doesn’t come with a block just a usb cable. So you better hope you have an extra block laying around.For the price you are paying for the speaker you should get a fast charge block with it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big quality sound for a great price,5,"I purchased the same product about 1.5 years ago but made the mistake of buying it refurbished to save a few bucks. The battery eventually wore down to holding less than an hour charge and before the first year was up I couldn't recharge it anymore so had to dump it. But, this same model is at such a great price I'm buying it new and love it! the sound is huge from this small speaker, it fits in a golf cart perfectly, holds a charge for about 7 hours so far at 100% use, and the price is great! I did my research and this is the best model unit for the sound and price. You won't be disappointed. And buy new, refurbs are a waste of money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a kick-but little speaker!,5,"I absolutely love this speaker.  Its got great volume - and the battery lasts hours and hours.  I charge mine once or twice a week, and I use it hours daily.  Sound quality is great - the Bluetooth connection is solid once you get it set up, but it was hard to get my phone to connect the first time.  Though that may totally be a DEU problem lol."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,I liked this speaker so much I bought this one as a replacement to the one I had received before as a gift.  I needed to buy a replacement because the first one stopped accepting a new charge and just stopped working.  So know that this speak has a built-in obsolescence.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Literally good bang for your buck,5,"Quality sound, good bass without distortion"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Solid unit, affordable portable sound",4,"About the size of a large can of energy drink, but good sound for the money. A bit light on the bass, but good enough for 90% of music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent speaker phone,4,"For a device about the size of a 16 oz beer can, this has very good sound.  Is it a replacement for high quality speakers as some have said? Not even close!  But I don't think it is reasonable to expect that from a device of this size.  Part of my reason for selecting this particular model was for use as a hand free speaker when I work in remote, mobile offices.  This thing excels in that role.  With a group of people in the room, 8-10' away, they can speak in a normal voice and is very clear to the person on the other end.  It also does a good job of canceling back ground noise."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for everything,5,"Love every detail, sound quality and battery life. It's worth it. Won't hesitate"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",PLANNED OBSOLENCE?,3,"It worked for about 3 years, but I am surprised it's life is over.  It seems like it's charging but when disconnected it won't turn on.  Doubt we'll replace it with another JBL speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High Quality Speaker,5,"This speaker is amazing. The sound quality is great and I love listening to music and podcasts in the shower. It’s waterproof and durable. I dropped it a few times and it hadn’t taken any damage. The battery lasts a long time, too. It’s a great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Jaw-dropping, crystal-clear sound",5,"Where's the option for 10 stars? This has jaw-droppingly rich sound. I couldn't believe my ears as I stood in awe listening to this play 2Cellos' ""With or Without You."" The acoustics are absolute perfection; crystal-clear, with base notes having real depth and vibrato to them as if I were listening live. Simply amazing. I bought this because my friend had a waterproof speaker from another brand that we took kayaking with us - hers cost twice as much as this one but this one is smaller and sounds incredibly better. I am in auditory heaven!UPDATE: 7/23/2017I took this kayaking tonight. Without going into details, this speaker ended up accidentally, completely submerged in the lake... and played beautiful music the entire time. So, I am updating my review to add, this is tested and verified waterproof as advertised!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Simplicity of the speaker and clean sound,4,The speakers are great in.a small space ... but go outside and they can't compete with the collection of outside noises. You open your eyes and realize how weak the speaker is amazing sound indoors a quiet house and one of my two speakers will not charge and Amazon requires I speak with JBL rather than process of product exchange after all JBL has a lifetime warranty and replacement of 1 to 3yrs these days. It is in the connection from the charging cord to the device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"Love this speaker, it has great sound from such a small, compact speaker. I really love it! Highly recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Bluetooth Speaker,5,"Sound, battery life, connectivity, is great, I really enjoy my speaker. I use it for traveling to listen to my music I have on my phone, or pandora! Good price! ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A really great sounding product,5,"I don't normally do reviews.. (only negative ones) by I'm actually astonished at how good this sounds compared to other portable speakers.We use this speaker in the kitchen and outside on the patio, typically streaming music from bbciplayer (radio 1), amazon music etc.We use it every day really.(Note: I don't use this to truly 'listen' to music as I have a high end amp / speaker setup for that...)I've been through 3 or 4 $30 ish, cheap speakers (returned a few of them) and I am amazed with the difference of how this sounds.Its just got decent volume and all around sound (good bass/treble etc).You do get what you pay for and paying a bit extra for this was defiantly worth it.(FYI. I'm not been paid etc for this review...)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great when we’re outside in our hot tub. Sound quality is great. Small but mighty,5,"This is surprisingly small but mighty. Easy to use, very portable, sound quality is great. No worries is gets a little moisture."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Sound. Small Footprint.,5,"These little speakers are amazing! I use mine at work, and bring it home on the weekends. I liked it so well, I bought another one for my significant other. We tethered them together, while Camping, a couple of weeks ago. Had surround sound at the lake.Well worth the money..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 vs. Trelab HD77,3,"I purchased both the JBL Flip 4 and the Trelab HD77.  Both are good speakers for their size. I was impressed with the volume output from relatively small speakers, but found the bass disappointing in both.  Lack of bass is to be expected for the small size.  I did find that placing the speakers in a corner or under kitchen cabinets made a material improvement to the lows for each. I think you can get the same effect by placing them in a medium size open cardboard box as the bass reflects off the walls of the box.  I would be relatively happy with both, but ultimately I'm keeping the Trelab as it was 14 dollars less at 66 bucks compared to 80 bucks for the JBL Flip 4.  In addition, the trelab is slightly larger weighing in at 11 ounces compared to 9.2 ounces for the JBL Flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What a Delightful Speaker,5,"Amazing little speaker!! It is great for listening to music or taking calls for work.  The sound quality and weight are perfect for the size.  I have used it near water, in the house, in the garage, and on the go.  I enjoyed it so much, I have given them as gifts too."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"Wonderful speaker, worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Speaker!,5,"I bought the JBL Flip 3 on the recommendation of friends who rave about their JBL bluetooth speaker. I bought this one on Amazon while on sale and have been thoroughly impressed with the sound quality, volume, and range. I use it while working out, on my bike trainer, working in the garage, or just hanging out with the kids outdoors. I could not be more pleased with it at this point in time! I also purchased a travel case, which I highly recommend for protecting your investment."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds real good,4,Battery could last longer
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get a color you like.,5,"I bought this for my mom, she loves it! I actually bought her two so that she can have a small surround sound system on the go. I have owned JBL speakers for years and they have never let me down. The sound is great, it has a little base but it's not enough to distort the audio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,"I love this speaker. I have had others that were very disappointing. This was great. It started with the packaging - lovely - nice tabs, organization, box. Then the sound! Terrific! I am not a music snob, but I am somewhat picky about sound and the sound from this speaker is wonderful. I am very pleased."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Sound, Good Value",5,"This is the best of the 5 bluetooth speakers in my possession. I think it is also the most expensive, but you get what you pay for. The main use for this item is playing music from my bluetooth transmitting device, and it does connect very quickly when I power it up.As far as sound quality, it is what I would expect from JBL. I  currently own consumer as well as professional sound reinforcement speakers from JBL. The Flip 4 exceeded my expectations - considering the price. By the time I want another similar item, maybe the Flip 5 or 6 will be out by then. I can't wait to hear how the future will sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Buy 1, not 2.",5,"The speaker is excellent. I used two, paired in stereo, with a Fire tv. First I tried connecting one speaker to the tv by Bluetooth and then linked the two speakers using JBL Connect app. This resulted in intermittent static which went away when I connected the first Flip to the tv with a cable. I then connected the 2nd Flip to the 1st with JBL Connect app. This cleared the static but the app isn’t reliable. It switches off stereo sound without warning. If you are buying one it’s a good product. If you are hoping for reliable stereo (which is excellent when functioning) there must be a better product. I returned mine. Great hardware is undermined by JBL’s unreliable  software."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful little speaker,5,"Bought this speaker for my 16 year old son. It has nice sound, he was able to connect the Bluetooth from his phone to the speaker in seconds. Battery life lasts most of the day for him and he uses it for everything including music, gaming, watching TV, etc. He uses it everyday & is pleased with the purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker with fantastic sound!,4,"This speaker looks and sounds amazing! It is just the right size and the battery life is fantastic. I love that it is waterproof and durable because it gives peace of mind during our outdoor activities. It arrived just in time for our camping trip, everyone raved about the speaker and asked what kind it was/where to buy one. The only reason I gave it 4 stores is because I wish there was a button to skip a song on the actual speaker. It's not a huge deal or a deal breaker though. I can skip songs and change volume from my Fitbit or phone so it is still manageable but I would love to have that feature in a future model."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,Excellent bass and overall sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Updated to 5 stars,5,"UPDATE: Does last 12 hours if not all the way up 100% volume on a bicycle out on trail. It works 12 hours inside. It works 3 hours full blast on a bike. Got caught in major downpour, left in my water bottle cage. No problems just cleaned the dust from another ride. I would like 12 hours on full blast. Can’t complain though.Original: Just a little over 3 hours of battery life on a FULL charge. How is this close to 12 hours?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Auto play,4,"The sound is great, so far the battery is great. But when you go out of range and come back in range it should start playing automatically. Although the range is a lot further than my old one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It Bumps,5,Loudest Bluetooth speaker on my block tell you that
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Won't hold a charge - sound cuts in and out,3,"I've had this speaker for less than 2 years. I LOVE the sound quality (for the most part). About a year ago, the battery life began to decline. I was not able to listen for more than a couple hours before needing to plug it in and re-charge. Now the speaker will show a full charge (all dots lit up) but will die and shut down within a half hour at times. Also, when playing, the speaker will cut in and out and makes scratchy noises before it dies completely. I thought that at this price point I'd have something that would last a lot longer and I'm pretty disappointed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",pretty good,4,works great sounds amazing but when i’m connected to my phone and try to take a video on snap it stops playing on the speaker and it switches back to my phone audio
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Perfect wireless speaker, great for outdoor or next to swimming pool.",5,"This is great speaker. Perfect size, not too big not to small - just accurate in my opinion. It is waterproof what is big upgrade versus JBL Flip 3 which was just splash proof. Sound is clear with just right amount of bass. It also have voice assistant integration feature. Very easy to pair with your phone and if you have more then one (or some of your friends brought another one) you can connect them together for even better music experience. It comes in 9 different colors you can chose from. I highly recommend it, not only to take your music with you wherever you go but also for listing at home. Total worth money I have spend on it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",pretty good,4,not a massive amount of bass but it is a great speaker.i use it in my gym and in my car and it is very good.can get majorly loud if you want it to.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent!,5,So easy and good quality and my favorite speaker ever!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"Very happy, good quality, connects faster than most, would buy again!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud & crisp!,4,This superior speaker performs so much better than my old one and I don't have to worry if it gets wet. It's nice and clear and holds a nice charge. The only flaw is that the length of the charging cord is a bit too short.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best choice for the rught price speaker,5,I prefer the 5 any day but the 4 is where the gold is at for me and it should to you. Everything runs on bluetooth and rarely aux but the flip 5 dont got it so where do you go? You buy the flip 4 here for the right quality and price
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for a mechanic,4,Has great sound and volume. I'm able to hear it good over the sound of diesel trucks while working or driving but I can't give it a 5 star. The batteries only last 2 hour maybe 3.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound and waterproof,5,the speaker is easy to connect with bluetooth and sounds really good when you are doing activities and just listening.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!!!,5,"This product is superiority in itself!!!?? If I could afford to buy three more I would as it has the ability to connect to multiple JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth speakers... I have bought many Bluetooth speakers in the past couple years putting them in different places in my home and outside, but I find that the JBL Flip 4 is the best product in Bluetooth speaker that I have bought so far to date... I use one in front of my TV as a sound bar... I do not have to have an actual soundbar to have surround sound quality with the JBL Flip 4... It is easy and simple and fast connecting to your Bluetooth device!!! This product is power in a 6-inch Bluetooth speaker!!! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding quality and bass.,5,"This is the perfect device for any application. I use it when I go kayaking, working in the garage or anywhere I want to listen to my music from my phone's playlist. The bass and treble is perfect for such a little device. Great job JBL!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Less than expected,3,"I picked this more expensive unit for the sound quality improvements.  My use is to listen to audio books at night in the bedroom.  However, overall the unit missed the mark on many points.Pros:1.Sound Quality2.Bluetooth rangeCons:1.Annoying sound when turning on and/or off.2.LED charge lights annoyingly too bright and flash from time to time in normal use plugged into AC charger.3.Volume up/down in steps only with no ability to smoothly vary it.4.Unexpectedly the Bluetooth circuit failed in just over 2 years of normal use. (Luckily I can still use the ""old fashioned"" wired plugs to use it as a speaker paired to the phone.)5.Battery life not especially longer than any competitor."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Died in less than 90 days! UPDATE with more info.,1,"I am not rich and $80 is a pretty big investment for me to make in a speaker. I reviewed, reviewed and reviewed all these speakers for two weeks before being convinced this was ""the best."" And, for the first 60 or so days it was. But, out of nowhere, it has now just started turning off while playing music. Full charge, half charge, doesn't matter. It just turns itself off.Do you know how annoying it is to be listening to music and have to go up to the speaker every 10 or so minutes and turn it back on? I mean, come on, that's ridiculous, no? Read ALL the critical reviews on Amazon about this item. You will notice a trend about this sort of thing.The absolute BEST Bluetooth speaker I ever owned was the Soundfreaq SFQ-04 Sound Kick. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of letting my ex-wife have that, thinking I'd win by getting a brand new one. Wrong again. Also, the Soundreaq one was purchased about 6 to 7 years ago and guess what? Not only does it still work like a champ, but it has NEVER had any issues and sounds better than this one.If you are flush and have $80 to spend for 3 months of listening, by all means by this. If not, stay away or better yet, get a Soundreaq.UPDATE: Just realized the main reason I'm sure many of you want to buy this is due to it being waterproof. Just found out Soundfreaq made a follow-up to the model I had, the Sound Kick 2 and it is water resistant! You can find this on Amazon or even lower priced on eBay. Please, for me, buy this one instead."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Heat equals battery drain,5,"I can't be biased about JBL products... been one of my favorite products for decades.As for the JBL tube, the audio is excellent for the 26'x30' room I have it in, and the range of the Bluetooth connectivity exceeds most other devices I've had. Great product for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounding little speaker for beach/pool,5,"I've been very impressed by this. We've taken it to the windy beach and it sounded great. Battery life is long and lasts all day, but be prepared to charge it a few hours when it is low. I have not tried to take in the water, but it claims to be waterproof."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Real Deal,5,"Don't order this product from any other seller or website. I made that mistake the first time and spent too much on a shoddy knockoff. This one is the real deal and the difference in audio quality and build is obvious. I bring this to work with me on delivery days and my coworkers adore having this speaker around. I like my music loud and it's the perfect combination of volume and portability. The battery tends to run down quickly, like in a couple hours when it's on full volume, but turning it down a bit can conserve the battery life, or I just bring a charger with me. Worth every penny for the joy of music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!!,5,This Is A Great Speaker!! Nice Sound Quality And It Plays For A Long Time And I Dont Have To Charge It Very Much And I Use It Everyday. The Color Is Beautiful And Looks Just Like The Picture. Comes In A Nice Little Box And Has A Charging Cord USB.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","If you don’t like bass, this is the speaker for you.",2,"Just as the title says, there is no bass to this little thing. It’s aesthetically pleasing but the sound ha me feeling like travolta in pulp fiction looking for the intercom. It just isn’t there. I tried turning it up a bit but the sound started to distort and I was afraid to blow the speaker.So if you need a portable speaker that you have to be next to to hear and that has no bass, look no further.Instant return. 0/10 would not recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not that loud...really no bass...really disappointed for what I spent on it,4,it lasts as long as you need it to...if u want a bass speaker don't buy this one...ill be looking for a better one with more bass....jbl is a fail for me
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound in a small packakge,5,Just what I hoped it would be!  It sounds great and takes up no space.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Happy with product,4,"Works great, I use it every day at work in construction sites. I wish the battery life lasted longer but the price seems fair for a JBL product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charge cable faulty,4,The sound quality is not bad just don’t listen with volume turned all the up. Loud enough for most uses. Sound quality is pretty good. I use mine in garage during exercise. Only thing the charging cable is defective. The plastic in USB PLUG is centered it should be off set. Plug does not fit. Not a deal breaker though. I have other plugs that fit. Other wise I would give 5 stars
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Started crackling after one year,3,The speaker worked great for a year but then started to periodically crackle. We never used it at full volume so was disappointed it didn’t last very long.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Huge Sound From A Tiny Package,5,"I travel a lot and hate watching TV. I use this for music and movie sound from my iPad at the hotels. It truly sounds like a big speaker system. Highs, mids and lows all sound clean and clear. I challenge any of you to find a better sounding BT speaker for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Invincible,5,"Literally left this outside overnight in a heavy rain storm by accident and it started right up the next day. Sound quality was not impaired at all. Take this to the beach, pool etc. this thing is tough. Highly recommend it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality portable Bluetooth speaker,4,"This product is well-made, easy to connect, great quality audio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Great speaker that I really enjoy. My only issue I've had with it is that it sometimes has trouble connecting and playing music from my phone, but otherwise it's very good. It's pretty loud for it's size and has great bass, which is exactly what I was looking for."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds great, long battery life",5,"This is the perfect speaker for my golf cart. I purchased a separate holder for it. Plays loud, clear, we used this 4th of July weekend and only needed to charge it twice. It was a 5 day Holiday for us. Very impressed. Definitely recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Easy to use, great sound and range",5,"I bought two of these and when they arrived I was surprised how small they are. But they pack an amazing sound in a very small housing. The volume can be turned very high with little to no distortion at highest setting.It took less than a minute to pair the first one with my phone and connect the second one for party mode (I did not use the app).They also seem to have a pretty good range. I placed one speaker in the garage, kept the phone in my pocket for skipping songs and worked all over my large front and side yard never lost connection or had any other kind of issues.I haven't and won't test if they are really waterproof. ??So far I'm very happy with them."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bass and quality,5,"I love this speaker it’s sound crystal clear and the bass works really good, for in your hand perfect for Any ware you go definitely 100% you should get"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life horrible,4,The title says it all.. It has a pretty good sound but it’s not like loud!! I mean I use it throughout the house but I know it wouldn’t be loud enough of the beach or a kickback.. and I literally have to charge it everyday. The battery life last maybe 3 hours tops for me. I might have a defective one idk...
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, but it dies",3,"I bought this system just to have a better speaker sound and having my other speakers for years, i wanted a back up just in case. When i came across this speaker, i was so excited, in spite of some negative reviews of it dying on others. I really enjoyed the time i had with this speaker. I loved the rich bass, loudness, overall sound quality. The issue im having is it stopped working 3 weeks ago! I never dropped it, wet it or anything. It wont charge; just a complete disappointment. Its only been a few months! Oh! Also, it used to die after 2- 3 hours inspite of being fully charged."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fabulous,5,I loved everything about it easy to use and I use it for the pool
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible Sound In a Small Package,5,"Wow! Incredible sound in a small package! Solid bass, crisp high tones. Gives much cleaner sound than Bose Soundlink Color II. Every bit as good as it’s bigger JBL brother, which my son has, just a wee bit smaller. Easily connects to all of my devices. Highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a small speaker.,5,"This isn't a computer generated or paid review. Searched for a week for a bluetooth speaker that could go outdoors, was at least splash resistant (This one claims to be waterproof, I don't wanna test that out lol) and had decent db/watts. Read many reviews and decided on JBL. So far, this speaker has it all. Just got it today and tested it out. Sounds great, the high end sounds wonderful and the low end is fantastic. Seems pretty rugged and durable. Not sure how well the battery life is yet, but I should be able to get a few hours out of it at full volume. I would recommend if you this is in your price range. I'll update if there are any issues. But so far, so good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","10/10 Sound & function, we’ll see about battery life!",4,"Amazing sound, but I’ve seen some reviews about battery life decreasing over time... will update if it does. Worth it so far, esp since I got it on a whim when it was 50% off : )"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just as good as the bigger one!,5,"I bought this smaller one as I already have its bigger brother, the charge 4.  Sound quality is just as good! And they connect to make a great surround sound! I may buy a few more of these!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s worth love it,5,For me I think it should be a bit louder but that’s just me ?? I Hate that I can’t charge my phone like the other ones... besides that I love it I used it almost everyday is not bad for the size I love this Brand the battery ?? last long is worth buying...  ????????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not water Proof,4,"I finally got my little speaker wet, and it stopped working right. I had in my Kayak tied off to me, when I rolled out of my kayak. I have a little fishing kayak I was going down the river in. I became off balanced and flipped out. There not large rapids, it's just a cheap kayak and poor center of gravity.  At any rate the water wasn't very deep and I was able to stand up, drain and jump back in my kayak. Speaker keeps connecting and disconnecting now. When it worked, it had pretty good sound, good volume, ok bass line for it's size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,"Almost spent an additional $100 on a beats pill, but this work just as good if not better so definitely a good investment!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Teenaged son loves it,5,I bought it for my son for Christmas and he uses it everyday.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Money well spend,5,I love love love my Flip 4 JBL the sound quality is good the Bluetooth connectivity easy and battery is long lasting. I use it everyday to do chores while I’m getting ready to work or when I just want to dance it out with my kids or by myself I love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","sound quality, connectivity, battery life, design -  all excellent !",5,"I just wanted a bluetooth speaker for my phone and my laptop...  Reviews led me to jbl flip 4.  I totally love it so far.  Mostly I need excellent sound quality at all volumes...  If there was even a slight problem with sound quality I would return it and get something else...  This speaker is Very good quality...  Connectivity is instant, reliable.  Battery life is way beyond what i expected.  I am way more than satisfied right now... I take it with me everywhere !  Update 3 years later... Still the best speaker i own for portable blue tooth... Would highly highly recommend you buy it wherever you can find it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Well made and sounds great,5,These are the best portable speakers on the market. Surprisingly loud with full range highs and lows. Durable and well constructed. First speaker I bought 6 years ago and have brought it with me on countless outdoor trips. Works just as well now as it did on day one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase,5,Had this for over a year and the battery life is just as great as the first day I got it. So worth the money. I take this everywhere with me. Haven’t tested out the waterproof-ness of it because I’m just not brave enough. I’ve been through so many speakers and they all lose battery life so quickly no matter the price. Gets pretty loud I’ve used this by the pool and the beach on vacations and it’s been loud enough. If youre outside and have a lot of people around you might need to snag another one and link it though
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4 still FLIPPING,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Arrived on time & I'm already banging Dancehall & Reggae through the speakers!!!! #FLIPPING #Camo"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Like a Boss,5,"I cant say enough about this thing. I have ranted about it so much my friends and family heard it and purchased as well. Perfect sound for the size. I am a heavy traveler and take this everywhere. Hokds an awesome charge, sounds crystal clear with a little thump. Perfect for outside and fills the house with sound. I connect to my tv and sounds so much better than the stock tv speakers. Now with connect plus, you can connect numerous speakers together. I comnected mine and my Dads and sounds amazing. Need a liitle more bass? Use connect plus and an extreme and the neighbors will love you. These things are well worth the price, and live the JBL sound. Move over Bose, you have competition."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect bathroom speaker,5,I use this on the bathroom counter so I can listen to podcasts and news while taking a shower. Loud and clear. About the same size as a tall boy beer can. Battery life is many many hours. I use it roughly 25 minutes per day and charge it every two weeks or so
"JBL Flip 4, Black",B+,5,"Been looking for a relatively cheap option for a quality bt speaker to use while golfing and lounging outside, and I think the flip4 is the sweet spot.  20 and 30 dollar products just dont have the same functionality and rich sound you get with this speaker.It's extremely easy to use; I was listening to music within a couple minutes of opening the box. Came with 3/5 bars of battery power.Only fault I can really point to: even though it appears to be like a cylindrical room filling speaker, the audio is very 'directional' in that you'll notice a significant change in clarity when listening off-center or away from the JBL symbol."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent for its price,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It is an excellent product, it sounds excellent it is beautiful and I love it but I give it 4 stars because it gets dirty so easily. (btw the video is compressed)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A+++,5,Best Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever brought
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good thing in small package,5,"This little guy kicks really well. The range is great, you hear the bass yet it doesn't drown out the treble. Lasts all day of constant use and charges quick. Will play while charging. I take this skateboarding with me almost daily.Cool feature it will pair with another like JBL and play the same music so you have 2 speakers playing even though only 1 is actually connected to your device."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,It may be early but I’ve been using this speaker less than a week but have loved it so far Impressed with the sound and battery and the Bluetooth has a very strong connection been using this for grilling when working on vehicles or just about anything really it’s been wonderful so far
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No good way to stand it.,4,"Nice contact portable Bluetooth speaker. Apparently, you can pair it with other compatible jbl speaker to extend the range.I was disappointed that it doesn't have a good way to stand it. It doesn't really game a base. It's completely round. I've been standing on its end which is cantilevered and doesn't stand perpendicular. The bass drivers are out the ends of the tube so standing it this way drives the bass into the shelf and the other end into open air."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, great sound, my kids steal it though",5,"Like everything about the speaker. I would buy it again, and might have to because my kids now take it and scamper off with it.  One thing of note, is I have the best luck connecting it, by going to the ipad first and turning the bluetooth on, then pressing the power on button, on the JBL speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Buy!,5,"I love this speaker! I've had it a few months now and it still works as well as the day I first opened it. This thing is a survivor. I've accidentally dropped it a few times (the other day ON CONCRETE) and it didn't even scratch. The sound quality is great, battery life is long, and when it does take it's last tumble I'll definitely replace it with another one of the same :) LOVE IT!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Much better than Oontz Angle...,5,"This is the 4th small blutooth speaker I've owned and by far the best.  It blows the Oontz angle out of the water in terms of volume and bass.  This speaker works best in a smaller space without too much distance between it and the listener.  For it's size the bass is really great.  That said if you take it outside or into a large room it tends to feel a little tinny at high volumes, but for it's size I think it's the best in this category aside from maybe a bose.  Very happy. Definitely above average blutetooth speaker. Fine for bedroom listening. Bass is good. Terrible a tad tinny."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this speaker,5,I bought this speaker a couple years ago and it still is blasting music and it’s been through everything. Best speaker for your money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good investment!,4,"After seeing my music friends use JBL for years, I finally invested in a JBL. I actually caved because I wanted something that could carry music when hanging out in my backyard. I LOVE this and so glad I was able to invest in this. Looking forward to many more years with this baby here. The color is ON POINT and fun too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Speaker,5,Works pretty good. I'm enjoying the flexibility and the sound associated with a blue tooth speaker of this size. I have come to the conclusion that the louder the speaker and further away I stand the better it sounds. The batter life is very good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is what you’re looking for!,5,"This speaker is the best by far. We love it so much we bought a second one for my husband to bring to work. The bass is impressive, clear sound, and the battery life is long. Highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Quality!,5,"For such a small speaker, this little thing packs a punch! Very good sound quality. Crisp sounds. Picks up every detail in a song, including the bass and every instrument on between. We love it!Doesn't matter what you're listening to either.We've played metal, classical, even gregorian chants while playing warhammer haha. It's perfect!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality of the product and performance.,5,Almost all things are good except Bluetooth connectivity to my other device. It is auto connected to my ipad once the power on but when i tried to connect to my iphone even if i turn off to my ipad stl i could not connect the Bluetooth to my iphone. I dont know why!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",INSTRUCTIONS ARE USSLESS !,4,"First of all the sounds great but all that is pointless when you have instructions that are about 15% in English . No lie i thought it was a different book for Spanish & Japanese customers. Theres no way of finding hes dead. No way of starting up, troubleshooting & general descriptions . I was in awe. But my question is why do i hear loud thumps from inside speaker when its turned up real loud & you lower or increase volume !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker! Sounds great and has good battery life.,5,"This speaker has been a classic for me and my family, so when our old one broke I knew I had to buy another. 10/10"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Dead Battery,5,"Bought one speaker 2 years ago and it will not hold its charge after 1 year…. So I bought another 13 months ago and this speaker will not even charge now…. $200 plus wasted… good sound, but I need it to last…"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great portable, waterproof speaker",5,"Great speaker with admirable bass. I like how you can either stand it up or lay it down. The battery life seems pretty good too. I haven't used it continuously, but definitely a couple hours here and there, lasting multiple days or weeks without needing a charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No charger!,4,This is my 3rd jbl speaker. I like that it is water proof and it has good sound. I bought my last two through Walmart. This last one was through Amazon and it did not come with a charger. Makes me wonder if it was refurbished. The downside is they only last about two years. After that the charging port breaks.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound From Such a Small Speaker!,5,"Just received this little beauty a week before scheduled delivery date (gotta love Amazon)!  This little guy is a great speaker...I listen to a lot of bass heavy music (dance, edm, rap) and I'm pleasantly surprised at how it handles at the uppermost volume levels. Can't expect much bass outta such a small speaker, but it does have the radiators on either end that definitely push a little bit of air and achieve a good overall sound.  The clarity of this thing is very nice and unlike some other speakers I've heard, when the bass hits, the clarity does not suffer....gotta love that, shows great quality and that's how I measure how good a speaker is.  A sure recommend and the small size makes portability very accommodating....good job JBL!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound. Highly recommend.,5,"This thing sounds incredible for the size. You can legitimately feel the bass of the lows, the mids are punchy and warm, the highs are clear. There's no distortion at high volume. JBL knows how to build a speaker, even portable ones. Ive owned a few other brands in this size and they don't even come close to this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Happy,5,"Let me start by saying that I just purchased this a week ago for a long weekend.  I am not the most tech savvy person but this was very easy to setup.  For years, we have been using our laptop outside for music and I decided enough was enough.  For three straight days we played this in rather hot weather in the beating sun and each day it lasted around 9 hours.  The quality of sound was great and we had no issues at all with any skipping.  I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money but I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Solid build, decent sound, wish battery life was better",4,"Solid build, ok/decent sound, but I wish the battery life was better. I get about 4 hours at about 70% volume. Still, I'm glad I bought it and would buy it again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,Perfectly portable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great price for an awesome speaker!,5,JBL has an amazing sound quality.  We have several of these.  We take two to the beach and pair them for surround sound.  Waterproof and long playing on a single charge.  This is the smaller one but still has big sound.  Not exactly as crisp as our Bose but in a blind sound test it would be hard to tell which was which and for the value JBL wins hands down!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love!,5,"It was a lot smaller than I thought, but that made it all the better! Such a powerful sound from such a small device, so I was thoroughly impressed. Wonderful packaging, and instructions are fairly simple. I tried it out in my living room and the sound resonated through the entire house. Definitely will be using it for background music for dinner parties, and can be used for outdoor parties as well, since it is waterproof. It has a little strap that you could put around your wrist so you don't have to worry about accidentally dropping it. I wish they had a pink color, but the gray is super chic and matches any aesthetic. My sister wanted to buy her own after seeing mine. Definitely would recommend to a friend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It really is water proof,5,I bought the flip 4 because i was impressed with my brothers flip 3 . It connected with my phone easily has great sound . i am an audiophile and i still can not figure out how JBL gets such great sound out of a cylinder. I believe it has a class D amplifier in it.  I had it setting on a ledge in my bath tub and it rolled and fell in the water . I pulled it out dried it off and it works perfectly . the cylindrical shape makes it prone to rolling. Standing it up straight improves the bass but limits sound stage. plan on buying another one and connecting them .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great customer service!,5,I had this for about 1 year and loved it!  Never got it wet.  Never dropped it.  Never left it outside. However Last week it stopped charging.  However I contacted JBL and they'll replace it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The kids happy!,5,Works good
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Speaker, but iffy battery life",5,"The speaker is honestly really great. The sound quality is awesome and the volume is very powerful as well. My husband and I both have our own speaker for us to use at our workplaces. For me, the battery life is fine since I don’t have the volume up very loud. My husband, on the other hand, has to have his very loud at work, so his battery depletes really fast. He can only play it for three hours from a full charge before it dies on him, while mine can last all day long without charging at the lower volume settings. Other than the battery, the speaker is great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Dynamic sounds and hardy product makes this a great purchase,5,"First, this is a great portable Bluetooth speaker. My previous speaker was an Oontz Angle 3, and this clearly blows it out of the water. JBL Flip 3 has amazing sound quality for music, movies, and audibles. It has proper sound dynamics and range, at least that I can tell, at both low and high volumes. The bass is great, but not phenomenal. I love that it is waterproof. Sometimes I let it hang on the edge of the bathtub where it'll get wet but it still works. The Bluetooth pairs quickly with my devices, and the range is decent, I'd say standard. Only star knock off is the inability to skip songs (but you can pause and play) and lack of real strong bass sounds."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker for the money,5,Sound is great up until the top 10% of the volume which then gets a tad bit distorted. I do not hate on it for this though seeing as it is relatively small and still manages to sound really good even at 100%. At ~50% volume the battery lasts for 8+ hours in my experience. I have tested the waterproofing out by bringing it into the shower with me for some shower sing alongs and so far no issues. My favorite thing about it though is the Bluetooth range. It is so much better than some of the other speakers I have owned in the past. I can set it down and go anywhere in the house without any issues.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound of this product is beyond what I expected!!!,5,This has been just a great purchase!!! So easy to connect to your Bluetooth and the battery life last hours and hours
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery Life Shortened After a Year,3,"I do love this little speaker for its color, sound quality, durability, and portability, but the battery life sucks.  It was great for maybe the first year or so, but after a while I had to begin charging it after only using it for about an hour.  I only keep the volume about halfway up, only use it 1-2 times a week, and I don't have heavy bass on.  The battery life is longer with an aux cable instead of bluetooth (naturally), but I find the aux cables don't work really well with this - they get staticky and don't get full volume.  I've gotten used to keeping it plugged in to charge while I use it (though it never shows that it's ever fully charged anymore, even when charging while powered off), but for camping and hanging out by thr pool, I'd certainly prefer the battery life to be much longer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, you won’t be disappointed.",5,"We had an older JBL speaker that was a gift but we wanted another one. We have had other brand speakers but nothing that compares. Definitely worth the $.  Sound is so good even outside at the beach, camping, etc. They make great speakers!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hard to complain...I guess,3,"Loved it and used it a lot.  Recently the micro USB connection for charging ended up with all the pins bent and it no longer will charge.It looks like they have addressed this issue with the flip5, using a USB-c connection now.I went to see about getting support and possibly sending it in for repair but it says my window for support ended this past summer.  Why wouldn't they allow someone to send it in to get repaired? I don't expect the service to be free.  Oh well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Extremely impressed,5,"Admittedly, it has been several years since I’ve purchased a Bluetooth speaker so I’m not up to date with the product space.  I currently have several rooms in our house and garage connected to apple air ports with amplified speakers.  However, I needed something that I could use by our kiddy pool in the back yard so I purchased this speaker.  I am so completely impressed with the quality, sound resolution and portability of this speaker that I’m rethinking my entire house setup.  I almost can’t believe the amount of fidelity and bass response of this tiny speaker.  I typically don’t write product reviews but felt compelled to give credit to JBL for this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It has JBL connect plus instead of JBL connect.,4,This is a nice blutooth speaker don't really see a difference from JBL flip 3. Only thing which is different is it has JBL connect plus instead of JBL connect. Which makes this device the odd one out. I don't understand why JBL has done this. Now that all of my friends having a JBL connect I am unable to join in. I think JBL should give an update for all the newly launched products otherwise JBL flip 4 will just be stand alone device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,4,"This so far is the best sounding bluetooth speaker I've had and heard for the price, The quality and volume is amazing for its size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,"Could not love this little speaker more. The sound quality is great and it is powerful, we use it to play music outside but it is loud enough to use for a large party. Very portable and easy to synch up to…we love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",These are great. I was using the JBL for quite some ...,5,"These are great. I was using the JBL for quite some time and I never complained from them, until the unfortunate event where my nephew dropped them on the floor and the bass was busted. I went on to buy the FLIP 4  and the sound is noticeably better along with the quality and the great waterproof features ( which i don't really intend to risk using in the water, but it's good to know it's there)the only thing that bugged me is that the FLIP had a cover along with a charger, which was a cool feature. the FLIP 4 on the other hand, come with a charging cable only.nevertheless, the quality is great for the price and the built and design is FANTASTIC. Definitely recommended!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,4,"I’m not an audio snob, but this sounds great to me. Battery life isn’t all that impressive. Maybe 4 to 5 hours at the most. But it’s super handy to be able to listen to podcasts or audiobooks or music as i’m doing work around the house."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonder Bluetooth divice,5,Works like a dream the sound quality is great it’s connects to my Bluetooth devices instantly and so far the battery life is wonderful and it’s so sturdy you can take it anywhere! If this one disappeared I would purchase again And it’s waterproof
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Speaker,5,"Fantastic speaker, super loud for size, battery life is insane, waterproof feature is great. Bought this for our pool, camping, and boating, it's perfect. Packs a punch when it comes to sound, and is definitely worth the $$$$."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker. Mids and highs are nice and clear ...,5,"Nice speaker. Mids and highs are nice and clear even at max volume. As with all speakers this small, there is no real bass to speak. For battery life reference, I have a JBL Flip 3 that I play at work at low volumes (Five “+” volume clicks up from 0). I get about 10 hours of playtime. Outside at 100% volume with the Flip 4, I get about 2 hours. The Flip 3 and 4 both have a 3000mAh battery so they should be pretty similar. I bring the Flip 4 kayaking and have even spent time with it in the hot tub. The IPX7 rating really holds up. Just make sure the cover for the Aux /USB port is closed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Very cool, well made, a little heavy, heavy bass",4,"I didn't really need a speaker that could go down a meter in the water, so there's extra weight for that kind of protection, though it also seems pretty indestructible and well made. The sound is very heavily weighted to the bass, so I have to use an equalizer on my devices to make it listenable for me. Connects easily to any device."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great speaker,4,it's an awesome speaker.  I thought it would be louder but I love it and would buy again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL has the best speakers,5,This speaker works great! Sound quality is impressive and the battery lasts long!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,I use this at work and it is very handy and has survived many drops onto the concrete floor
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cool & great sounding,4,It’s a great sounding and long lasting rechargeable battery.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",muy bueno,5,muy bueno
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great quality, No wall charger. One Style flaw",4,"Impressed with quality. Really great sound, especially for the size. I dont need to max out the volume. I bought 2 of these and syncing them both up to my iphone is super easy with the app. It takes about 10 seconds.Taking away one star, because I feel like a wall based charger piece should have been included.And also, because JBL insisted on slapping me in the face with their red logo across the center while it is already on the side bass piece. Definitely takes the design down a notch in my taste when they force you to advertise for them. Remove it, or at least make it match the camoflauge pattern. C'mon..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible sound; Beyond impressed,5,"I almost never leave product reviews, but I felt compelled to let others now how great of a speaker this is. The sound is absolutely incredible and I couldn't be more impressed. The lows and highs are both pronounced, but without masking the mids. I'm blown away by this little speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,I love this thing so much! I wanted a speaker that had really good sound quality at higher volumes and that’s exactly what I got! I do wish the battery lasted a little longer but it’s not too bad!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Compact size, excellent personal sound.",5,When you go to the beach you don’t want a big bulky boom box to annoy everyone around you. Provides excellent quality sound for a one or two party use. Good background sound and surprisingly good bass. You can use it all day without charging. And I love the fact that it’s water resistant.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality sound,5,I bought this for quality sound in a small package that was also affordable that i could bring to work. This fit the bill. It replaces my computer speakers and i even use it for my virtual meetings.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charge 3 vs flip 4,3,"Bought this for my backyard to link up with my JBL charge 3. Took forever to link up, had to link it by the app but once it finally got done I was able to link them together. The flip isn't as good as the charge 3, I should of just bought another charge 3.The sound quality is spotty sometimes on it's own or hooked up to another speaker. When that happens I usually just turn it off and on until it doesn't sound like your on a cell phone hearing every other word. The volume doesn't get as loud as the charge 3. This speaker is good for when you don't have a big loud crowd.If you want a smaller speaker to carry around this one is good. If you want a speaker to compete with the crowd then charge 3 is the way to go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery,4,Battery is decent though I feel like it dies fast after use
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth issues,1,"Purchased this for my husband to take Microsoft Teams calls while WFH.  This device has some issues with maintaining a connection.  It makes a sound to indicate it has connected, however, it will randomly drop (as in shut off) in the middle of a call.  There is no sound to indicate this.  The person on the other end of the call just loses you and your PC/phone just shows the device as not being connected.  It goes to sleep without a reason why beyond that it has timed out.  It's not that the device is not in use or not sending/receiving for a set amount of time, though.  The device itself was not moved during the call and was about a foot away from the PC it was connected to.  Both the Flip and the PC are brand new.  Looking online, I see that if you set your phone/PC to full volume and only use the volume controls on the device that it will supposedly stay on.  I haven't tried this yet.  I did just update the firmware on the Flip so perhaps between the two it will work.Honestly for the price this is a pretty bad design flaw.  Not many people would be hard-wiring the device vs. using bluetooth.  I could understand a timeout after a set period of non-use, but not while the device is actively being used.  That's just weird.Overall the sound is ok so I guess I'll keep troubleshooting.  I'll give it a couple days and if it doesn't improve I'll return it.  If I had to buy over again I would choose a different product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL knocked it out of the park with this one!,5,I would have never thought such good quality sound can be produced by such a small speaker.  This thing really is great.  And the fact that you can pair several of them together (they say up to 100 but to be honest that overkill) is great.  I've got a second one on the way!Quick Update:I now have three of these.  Pairing them together couldn't be simpler. They hold a charge for a long time too.  Also hooked one up to an old radio using a 3.5mm cable.  Puts the radios speakers to shame.  Can't say enough positive things about these Flip4's!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and easy to use,5,The song quality and Bluetooth connectivity works well since I'm in a loud vehicle for most of the day. The battery life holds up but since I keep it plugged in most of the time I like how it stays on and I can continue with my music at any point in time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality muddy.,4,"While I am happy with my purchase, I am a disappointed and confused about the sound quality. Reviews I read all mentioned a lack of bass. I found this speaker very bass heavy and the mids very muddy and weak sounding. Not real sure why this is the best, when you can buy small computer speakers for this price and size that are much more accurate. Sure would be nice if they would put a simple EQ circuit in these things. Cost would be a couple of dollars or just get rid of the speaker phone/computer interface stuff.The build quality seems to be solid.Just wish it sounded better."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for small speaker !!!,4,"Bought this for my husband, and he loves it!! We keep it in our covered patio and it’s perfect for our Bluetooth listening! I highly recommend!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy buena bocina de gama media,4,"Esta construida con muy buenos materiales. El sonido se escucha muy bien, quizás hubiera esperado mayor volumen pero para ambientar una sala o tenerla alrededor en un viaje a la playa esta perfecta. Y a diferencia de la flip 4, se carga mucho mas rápido."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best sound for sub $100. I own 2.,5,"Bought 2 already and will keep buying the Flip 4. Its simple to use, has the precious 3mm jack, rugged, battery goes for hours, and the best part -- it sounds better than some $300 models."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL vs Bose,4,"I thought I would save some money by getting the JBL vs the Bose. I already have several Bose products, and this was going to an extra speaker for travel, etc.I did like the new features, cool sounds when turning off and on, and when Bluetooth connects, more waterproofing, longer battery life, to name a few.BUT...when placed beside the comparable Bose (Soundlink Color series), the Bose absolutely blows JBL away. NO CONTEST.These speakers last for YEARS. Ask yourself if you would pay 40-50$ more for truly wonderful, full bass, and gloriously real sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Legit,5,Legit
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth Speaker!,5,Works great- easy to use and very portable. Very clear and crisp sound when it plays music and can get very loud. I have had a much smaller version of a JBL speaker and it works awesome as well. It is about the size of a medium pop from McDonalds- if you are looking for size. Definitely recommend this brand and this speaker to anyone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 great blue tooth speaker,5,"l am a mnobile dj and was in need of a new portable speaker, l have powered QSC12s that I use for weddings, but was was looking for something for rehearsals that smaller, lighter and great sound like many of you, I was a little overwhelmed after doing an Amazon search and finding literally tens of thousands of bluetooth options to choose from. It's especially frustrating because probably the most important part of the product -- how good it sounds -- is not something you can really evaluate until after you physically have it. So far so good, the packaging from JBL is impressive its self, great design. l havent tried to see how water proof lt is and probably want, but great to know lt is"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bass was disappointing,2,Listened to the speaker for less than three minutes. The bass quality was lackluster at best.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and easy to use,5,"We bought one because my sister-in-law had one, and we liked it.  These have long battery life and sound fantastic.  It can get loud.  Used it on the beach last week.  Very portable.  Love it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for water sports!!,4,"I absolutely love my JBL!! It is definitely waterproof ?? ?? lol the only reason I took a star off is because I thought it would be louder...it is decent I just excepted a little bit more from JBL on this one...still great buy though. The battery lasted me all day playing tunes...at least 4-5 hours straight. When water gets in it, you go need to shake out the droplets because it causes the volume to be even lower...pairs easily with my iPhone (haven’t tried any other device pairings) All the functions are simple to use. All in all can’t go wrong with quality and sound..volume is decent (would still buy it again)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No charger included,4,"Love this and the sale price was awesome. Little disappointed it did not come with a charger (unless I missed it). But it uses the standard chargers, and we have a few in our home."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome thing! Get it! Sound. Accessibility. Battery. All good!,5,Awesome sauce of a thing. Took it everywhere on beach in house at pool in forestThe sound is wonderfulI had my own dance room wherever I wentI even carried it in broken down cars of Carribean land as my boom boxLove it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker for price,5,"Great speaker for the price. Gets very loud, I usually play it at half volume or less. Very little sound distortion. Will try to update review once I’ve tried the waterproof feature and get a better idea for the battery life.Edit: battery life is at least 5 hours. Ran it for just more than a 5 hour grad party. Definitely very waterproof. I use it in the shower all the time, but I’ve never submerged it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,5,"For the money it’s a pretty great speaker.  Sound is above the price tag, specially on the discount I found.  I’ve listened to this thing for more than 5 sessions and haven’t charged it once yet.  Factory charge was STRONG.  No issues at all."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds great really surprised, one small issue.",4,"This thing is incredible.  I didn't expect such a rich sound from such a small device. Good volume as well.  Rich tight low end, sparkling highs, and smooth mids.  My only complaint is it gets really glitchy when I want to use it with my desktop.  Works great with streaming music from your phone but, when connected to a desktop it stutters and then pauses and causes the video (if you're watching youtube for example) to pause as well.  Strange. Not my inteded use so it's no big deal.  And, other than that, has been an excellent purchase.  Recommended"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice device,4,"Great little device, packs nice sound. Only issue I have with it is the battery life. Gets me through my work day for about 5 hrs of an 8 or more hour day. I dont plan to test the waterproof part of it not that I dont trust it I just dont work around water. I do however work in a body shop and it keeps us working with good vibes through the jb flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,"Wonderful little speaker. I wasn’t intending on buying but when cyber Monday came around the price was so good for this little speaker, I had to go for it. It came as promised, I had heard the sound of this speaker before and was very pleased. It fills a room very nicely, I had also bought a bike mount and will use it come spring time. Of the price comes backs down again I’ll pick up a second cause the speaker has a party mode to link many of them together."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,Teetered on what speaker to buy.I don’t need to rock the house like I did when I was younger. This fills the room nicely though.Good sound quality. Small enough to take hiking/biking/camping.Time will tell on battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,4,"This thing sounds great. Long battery life and really user friendly! My only complaint is that the bass is lacking! Still though, I'd highly recommend this!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ease of use,5,"The units arrived as scheduled and were easy to sink up and use.  The instructions are plentiful and in several languages.  Print is very SMALL -  So you may need a magnifying glass.  Other than that, the speakers are solid and sound good for the price.  A good deal."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Deal!,5,Great device for this price! A no brainer early Fathers Day gift! The sound is great and loud when needed. My son has the 5 which is a little bigger but not a big difference in my opinion. JBL has made great speakers for years!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small but powerful,5,Battery last a long time
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get the Anker speaker. Louder and rectangular,3,"Got this in 2018, hardly used it. Woke up today to use it and it won’t even turn on after a charge. Further research says I need a new battery for an item that should work new.My Anker speaker (my primary portable speaker) is louder, more durable, older, more compact, lesser in price. It only lacks the lasso.I would like to return this JBL, waste. Could not even last as a back up speaker. I’ll never buy a JBL again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker !,5,"Even better than expected. When I bought this, I wasn't too familiar with the JBL brand, but a few people I knew had a JBL speaker and really liked them. The sound quality is great and being waterproof lets me hang it in the shower.  A very good product !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Quality, Top of the Line Speaker!",5,"Excellent quality speaker. Was in the market for a loud, but small speaker and this does the trick. I love that it’s water resistant and can play through and aux cord. I recently have been attaching it to my record player and it’s been awesome!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Out of the box , it seems to be  all that you can want. Time will tell what the product is worth..",5,"I haven't had this thing long enough to give a proper review.So far so good. The sound quality is good.Its very easy to use, and does all that I wanted.I will have to see how the battery stands up in extended use and over time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I also got the hard case.,5,"I like it a lot. It connects right away. The sound is great for it size.  I even bought the hard case for it as well.  I plan to take it camping ?? in a few weeks.  Currently, I use it for the patio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Got to have my music when I am camping and the flip 4 is perfect,5,I am really enjoying my flip 4. I spend a lot of time outdoors so this is perfect for those camping trips. The quality and battery life  is much better than I expected. I have 2 of these and they will be perfect for up coming family gathering.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",More of an indoor speaker than outdoor.,3,"I bought this item, skeptical because I am not a JBL fan and because no where does it say what the Wattage of the speakers are. Soooo based off of the reviews of customers and the description provided, I purchased it. Is this speaker loud, yes its its, however here is the issue. This is more of an indoor speaker and not an outdoor speaker. While indoors, you will be amazed at how load this baby is, it truly fills up the room. But once outside, it loses it umph. I own several blue tooth speakers and I like to buy new ones to upgrade from my old ones. I bought this for the purpose of biking and sadly it will not stand up to my other speakers such as my treblab and transmart. With that said, I am slightly disappointed. If you want an indoor bluetooth, then by all means, this is the one and you can forget the rest. But if you want a speaker for outdoors, where there are no walls to bounce sound off, this will not suffice.It also charges pretty fast and does last close to 12 hours. But again, if you want something for your apt, home or office, this is the best you can get for the price and size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Enable Bass Mode (Low Frequency Mode),5,"I wasn’t initially impressed with the speaker, but after enabling Low Frequency mode it sounded a lot better.To enable this feature, press and hold the volume down and Bluetooth logo button down for ~10 seconds or until the power light blinks. This enables/disabled low frequency mode."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Give plug. Cars are sold gassed. Houses with ovens and couches with seat cushions. Keep customers.,4,I don't like that the speaker doesn't have a charging base. I spent a lot of money to not be able to play the speaker. How does that work as good business?
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Aux cord doesn't work,2,"I enjoyed my speaker until I went on vacation and the hotel wifi didn't reach outside. I smiled, because I love being prepared for everything, pull out my iPod classic, plugged in the aux cord and silence. The aux cord doesn't work. WTH!!! Now it's just a speaker for around the house. That's the last time I take it anywhere. I need a Bluetooth speaker that has a working aux jack. I plan on traveling this weekend and most of rest of the year. Now I can travel with less  covid restrictions and I find out that my speaker is limited to my hotel room. NOT HAPPY."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Sound, perfect size!",5,"Great sound and size for the Flip 4.  I just bought it and have been using it at the beach all week.  I love that you can hang it, under the beach umbrella for instance.  Just need to pick up a caribiner to clip to stuff.  I was impressed with the sound from the time I turned it on.  Easy to pair with my iPhone and stream any music service I have.  I was debating between the Charge 3 and Flip 4.  I'm glad I picked the Flip because of the more compact size.  I'm sure the Charge is great and likely improved sound due to larger size, but I like this one being a little smaller."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,4,"I would have given it 5 stars but the instructions were not clear on the set up.  I had to look it up on you tube.,  Once set up I loved it and the sound quality is great.  I have only used it once since it is a recent purchase so not sure about the battery life.  I played it all night at a ladies night and the battery was fine.  The blue tooth connectivity worked fine."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",USB port got loose so you couldn’t charge after only 2 years. ??,3,Good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente,5,Ecxelente
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes!!  Nice Sound,5,"The JBL Flip 4 is a GREAT speaker!  The sound quality is awesome.  My kids love to take it in the shower so they can switch songs (still scares me a bit, but they do it and it keeps working).  The speaker is sturdy and tough.  It has a nice strap to carry it.  The range is great!  My son listens to stories from my phone.  I can keep my phone with me downstairs while he goes upstairs to listen and play legos."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",More than expected,5,"I don't normally take the time to review the products I buy on amazon, but this little speaker delivered a lot more than I could ever have expected. I bought this speaker to use at work and home (I work in a shop that is very loud with pneumatic tools constantly being used). Sounds great, has great battery life, and is also waterproof on top of everything else and just seals the deal. I would like to see the battery life increased with the upcoming models but I really can't complain when it sounds as great as it does. I wouldn't even look at another bluetooth speaker and would recommend this to anyone that was quality sound and some durability along with it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Well worth the purchase.,5,"Great, clear sounds with good bass.  I would buy it again.  No problems so far.  Ordering a carry case since we will be using in the vehicles, outdoors, camping, etc. Plenty loud enough in car but honestly could go aliens higher overall."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Love this little speaker. I carry it around my wrist around the house, outside, so nice to have. Very happy with the quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good sound, poor battery",3,"Can't charge and play, must be charged prior to use. Also uses a micro USB, would work better with type c. Good sound, connects to bluetooth quickly and without fail"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Sound,5,The JBL FLIP 4 was recommended by my niece.  I was shopping for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker.Best investment I’ve made. The sound is terrific coming from a small device. Connection was easy.5 stars!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for the money,5,Great for the money
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny...,5,"I've had the speaker for 1 day, but I have used it for hours. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is fantastic. The level of bass, given the size and price of the speaker, is very good. I am using it with a laptop in my home office today with a streaming radio service. Last night I used it to watch television in the bedroom- via Roku remote on my iPhone. The quality of the materials is nice, and it has a solid feel. The range of the blue-tooth is great. It is plenty loud for my needs, and I like that I could pair up another one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great, while it lasts.",5,"Great sound and everything, however it doesn't last long. I bought the flip 4 and it took a crap before a year. Tossed it, thinking maybe it was my fault and then got 2 of the flip 5's and both took a crap before 4 months. They make a loud screeching sound eventually while youre listening to music until it eventually one day won't turn on anymore... or even charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound in a little package,5,"Outstanding sound quality. You definitely get your money's worth with this one. I have been using it for a couple days now and the battery is still unphased (granted, I haven't cranked up the volume on it much). I really like the design of it because you can orient it in a variety of ways. You can have it oriented vertically, horizontally, or you could hang it on something with the string that comes attached. It also connects really fast. As soon as I press the power button, it is instantly connected with whatever device I have with the bluetooth setting turned on. If this is right in your price range, I think you should absolutely go for this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I own 2!,5,I received one as a gift last year and I knew that I wanted to add another to my home. I now have one upstairs and one downstairs. This is the best blue tooth speaker I've ever owned. It has great sound quality and easy blue tooth connection.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very impressive speaker,5,Really great sound from a tiny package. Bluetooth connected very intuitively and I’m a Bluetooth novice. Not sure on the battery life but taking it on a beach vacation next week and will see how it plays out (pun intended).
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound.,5,Great sound and good size.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Looks pretty, crisp sound.",5,"This cute device definitely wins the style category. Also got that crisp, not too heavy bass which fills the room. Got that mic and 3.5mm jack that they removed from the flip 5!Hope it lasts a good 5 years. Will update."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend,5,"My husband actually convinced me to order this JBL Bluetooth speaker, I was looking for something less expensive. However, the money was so worth it! The sound quality is great, it hooked up easily to both of our mobile phones (I have an iPhone but my husband has an android phone). The charges last a long time. I highly recommend this product!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound and quality is amazing,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I received this in the mail yesterday and I LOVE it! I purchased the speaker in teal. It is a shade or two darker than the picture but it’s still a pretty color.I love the way the buttons on the speaker press and the sound quality is amazing.Like the video attached, I love the way the speakers move with the bass. So far, so good !It’s smaller than what I imagined and I love it because it makes it more portable.Such a cute and stylish speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love that I can pair it with my daughters and ...,5,"This little speaker has outstanding sound quality.  And battery life too.  Love that I can pair it with my daughters and get even more powerful sound.  I bought a very similar 'Monster' speaker from Sam's and tested it out....and there was no comparison with the JBL.  The quality of the JBL allows you to hear dynamic layers of the music.  Other speakers sound ""flat"" in contrast.  The JBL also sounds loud outside....which is difficult for these little speakers with no walls to reverberate soundwaves off of.  The JBL handles it like a champ!  If you are on the fence about this....just get it.  You won't find a better one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Bluetooth speaker!,5,"If you are looking for great sound quality, long battery life and the ability to connect two speakers for great sound in a large area (or just use one), without spending $100's of dollars- your search is over. My son got one of these a few months ago and I liked his so much that I bought my own. He uses both of them at times. Sound quality ?? Battery life?? Price point ?? All of this and it's waterproof too!! We will definitely be using these by the pool, at the lake on the boat and take them in the jet skis for when we stop to swim. You will not regret this purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound Easy to Use,5,"The unit was easy to setup and use, linked up to my smart phone on Bluetooth - no problem, and the sound provides for full spectrum with deep base. I got the version in red so I don't accidentally leave it in a hotel when I travel again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can't Go Wrong at this Price,5,"Great speaker for those looking to stay under $100. Easy to pair and play. When charging, it lights up with different dots to show you the progress up to when it is fully charged. Nice and sturdy with enough weight to produce nice, full sound. The bass won't blow you away with these kinds of smaller bluetooth speakers, but this one has sufficient enough to satisfy. And it looks great. JBL quality. What I expected and what I got."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Rich Big Sound - Great Battery Life,5,"This smaller speaker compared to the larger Flip 4s can do the same. Full charge time does take about 24 hours, but lasts for a couple of weeks. Great full loud sound and battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I LOVE MY SPEAKER!!,5,"This is the best speaker I've tried so far, the price also is pretty great. I ordered (and paid more for it) in red, it came white which i HATE (and was less expensive than red), i'm disappointed with the seller for this and the shipping time; it took one month to arrive, which was not estimated at the beginning. The speaker sounds amazing, loud and clear, the battery life is also great, i charge it once or two times in a month and lasts days and days playing all types of music medium to high volume. I would definitely recommend and buy this speaker again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sounds is incredible,5,The system works greatSound quality is amazing
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommend,4,"Good sound. Volume is loud enough for me... I do not listen to music full volume. Don't like that speaker has to be in a certain position to get full sound, but can live with it. Also...noticing that when my son is using his cell phone nearby, music tunes in and out for lengthy periods of time. Not my mp3 player...I suspect bluetooth connectivity. Other than that, really like this speaker. Enjoy it for both indoor and outdoor use. Would recommend buying a case for protection."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,5,"Just as described, arrived on time and sound quality is awesome"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Like a new set of Ears,5,This is aGodsend for anyone with hearing issues. We use it with our AppleMacBook pro that has a lousy microphone.Now we can hear clearly and watch movies and videos on in.Could not recommend it higher.We did buy a long cord to attach it to the computer while watching together.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Needs a better marking system,4,"What a great little speaker!  Unfortunately, the controls on the box are so well blended into the camouflage background, that you can't see them, so it's difficult to adjust unless you really know the instrument.  Since I use this in a guest house, there is a lot of explaining how to use it.  Could use a direction paper or booklet to explain operation."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality and battery life,5,"The sound quality is amazing! Battery life is all really good, you can go while between charges. Looks great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best bluetooth  speaker,5,We take our speakers camping and when we are outdoors.They are a quality product .we are very happy with our purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This baby bumps!,5,This baby bumps !My husband and I LOVE this speaker! We are music lovers and have always wished for a portable Bluetooth speaker that would put out good bass and sound quality without costing a fortune ! This is it !!  100% recommend... and it get loud :)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,"The sound is amazing, it hooks up immediately on the Bluetooth and I ran the speaker for five hours and it barely used two bars of battery life. I had it in my kayak and the water from the paddles didn’t even bother it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Expected better,4,The volume doesn’t go as high as I was expecting and battle life is not great either. My friend has the same speaker and I feel hers is better.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Sound,5,This is the third one of these I have purchased.  I bought one for myself and it was so great I have purchased additional ones because the sound is awesome and it's a great gift.  Easy to connect and use!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",FANTASTIC BUY,5,"My teenager bought this and it is a very powerful speaker.  He bluetooths to his phone and we can hear the music through the entire house. He has also poured water on it, and it is definitely waterproof.  Would recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery life on this sucks.,1,"The battery life on this sucks. It’s been almost a year since I bought this and it was working great for the first 5 months then all of a sudden it started dying after three hours of use and then, after eight months, it would die before the battery life was actually finished. So I started having to use the speaker while it was still charging and even then it would die while I was charging and listening to music. ?????? now it just makes a weird sound while playing music and dies in less than 30 minutes of Playing music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Out the box Joy,5,"WOW! I took it out the box. Turned it on, clicked the Bluetooth button and my phone paired. Done. Then I put on my favorite song and I am blown away. the Sound is amazing, and I'm used to Bose Noise cancelling headsets ... I LOVE This thing. it's louder than I will ever need, with very clear sound, I'm  love it !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't recharge too soon,5,Great speaker could not be happier holds a charge for ever .if you want your charge to last you have to play it till it is almost dead then recharge .it creates a memory.do not charge when it already has like 1/2 way or a 1/4.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s probably the most worth I’ve gotten out of my money,5,"The audio quality is really good, never had issues with connectivity and the battery life is great, been using it for hours on end everyday and it has never failed me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It does,what its supposed to!",5,"I love everything about it.My disappointment,comes in the battery,life,it claims,12 hours? Nope,about four,and then,its just blue-toothed to my phones,playlist,I still use a ""booster,app,on my phone,but yeah,about four,before,I have to reach for the charger cord,I even love that the charger,cord,is a fast charging model????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than described!,5,This is a small/compact speaker but don't let that dissuade you. This JBL speaker packs a punch and is a steal for the price! You will be very satisfied with your purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it,5,"I got it as a gift for my mom in red and I regret it. It works really well. A little too well. Now, I wake up to very loud videos and music and I’m regretting it.I have one as well and it’s good.I give it 5 stars it’s definitely worth the money.You can’t take your device and go more than 20-25 feet though but I don’t see that as a problem."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,The sounds coming out of the speaker was clear and amazing’
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 Unforunately Not Built To Last,2,I was very happy with the sound of the Flip 4 however after a few months I noticed the battery life started to diminish considerably. The battery life would last approximately 30 to 45 minutes going from a full charge indictor light to a blinking red light and then shortly after shutting off. I had to resort to keeping the Flip 4 plugged in order to work. Two weeks ago while listening to music high frequency sounds would start to distort and after a 10 to 20 second period the speaker would automatically shut off. After turning the speaker on the same high frequency sound distortion would return shutting my Flip 4 off rendering it basically useless. It works on most occasions if I am listening to vocal commentary but if I am listening to music the same high distortion problem occurs. My Flip 4 warranty has expired and I attempted to have it fixed but the two repair centers JBL recommended told me they don't fix Flip 4s because its economically unfeasible to do so (e.g. $50 just to diagnose the problem on a unit I spent $80 new for).In spite of this mishap I have been a fan of JBL Speakers. I really enjoy the sound. Years ago I had a JBL Flip 2 that stopped working after a year. I believe I was to blame for that speaker since I unfortunately exposed it to moisture. I have a Charge 2 that stopped charging and would no longer work even when plugged into the wall. The Charge 2 was out of warranty so I couldn’t get it replaced. So having my third JBL speaker not work for me has proven to be a huge disappointment.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy it,5,"I love the speaker, it always shocks people how loud it can get for the small size. The sound quality is great, the durability is great, it's dropped a few times, and no worries. I recommend you get it. Now, the only things is, sometimes it can lack the depth of sound quality, specifically when I hear what I believe to be a trumpet ?? playing on a jazz song, it doesn't sit well with me coming from this type of speaker. It's sort of annoying and I usually end up skipping that song that I like because of. But it's bearable, worth the purchase"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker but cannot syc with older models,4,Water proof tested by dropping in my hot tub a few times. Speaker will stop playback when it detects water then resumes play when removed from water. I hate how JBL introduces a new speaker pairing technology frequently making syncing older devices impossible.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It has good sound,5,Music in my shop
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"It's a good size to carry around and the sound is rich and just enough bass. Not sure that I need waterproof, but it's nice to know that it is. My son has the charge 3 but I wanted something a bit smaller. This has less bass than the charge 3 but still a nice balanced sound. I wish I could turn off the startup and shutdown sounds, but that's a minor nitpick. Comes with a cord so you can hang it, or it can be placed horizontal or on it's end but I think it sounds best horizontally. I compared with UE, Sony, etc. but I'm happy with this choice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,This is an amazing speaker. We can use it in the kitchen when we are making dinner or outside at a family BBQ. The sound quality is amazing and the fact it can connect to anyone’s Bluetooth makes it perfect for family use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",NOT WATERPROOF OR WATER RESISTANT!,5,"Took it to the pool, had it at the edge just getting splashed by some water but not submerged into the pool. When I turned it off it kept turning back on itself. So it is NOT WATERPROOF!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Even better than I expected!,5,The sound quality is incredible.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!!,5,Love it!!! I was looking for a good speaker this summer and especially for the pool. Came across the JBL flip 4 and made the right choice to buy it. Not only is it water proof but it has a great sound quality and battery life. I tested it on the pool submerging it and work perfectly fine after. I usually go a week without charging it and just charge on weekends when i need for the pool. I have to mention that i also bought the Wonderboom along with this speaker and it stopped working after it went in the pool.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love ??????,5,I love my new speakers. This one is bigger and it seems like it plays much louder than the older JBL speaker I had. And the battery life on this is way better than my previous JBL speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow! For the price amazing!,4,"This SHOULD be 5 stars across the board considering it's the size of a pop can and sounds pretty darn good. Not just for the size but good......period. I have one hell of a home theater and while this is nothing compared to that, it sounds as good as a nice 2.1 computer speaker set up BUT not near field. You have to be about 10 ft away from this baby to appreciate it and believe me you WILL. For 75 bucks I can't believe it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","great speaker, great sound",5,"I give it five stars and honestly it is very impressive sound for the size and cost. Yes you can crank it up full and distort it. Ive never seen a speaker that you cant.  It says its water proof but Im sure you can flood it out.  The battery seems to last a long time. I havent ran it until it died out. Its has some weight to it for its size but Im guessing thats how they get sound quality, battery life and durability out of it.  I plan on using it in the golf cart and utv.  Seems perfect for that"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Water proof, great sound",5,"Love this think, we take it out on our paddle boards and anywhere else you may need music that won't quite! Just a side not it has definitely fallen into the lake and come out still playing Rick Astley !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, survived a boxer dog attack",5,"I love this speaker, I am planning to get a new one. The sound is very nice, you wouldn't think it is so loud due to the size. I take it everywhere, it is easy to carry around. One day I made the mistake of leaving it on the lawn in the backyard after a BBQ get together, then my sweet, sweet boxer decided it was her toy. I found the speaker next morning all dirty, chewed on, decided to turn it on and amazingly it works perfectly. Not sure if it is still water resistant and not planning to find out."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound quality,4,"Sounds clear and loud so far,but the artery could have lasted a little longer for being this portable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Amazing product, highly recommend",4,"This product is very good, it automatically can connect to your phone and has great sound quality, the Bluetooth can cut out depending on distance away and potential thickness of the walls between but I had very minimal situations of that happening. I’d highly recommend, charging cord broke in my backpack so that’s partly my fault but wish it was a bit more durable luckily I had another cord that fit in the port so no issues here but be careful with the charging cord."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive,5,"I have a JBL charge 2 that i got 4 years ago, and its battery isn't lasting like it used to, so my husband surprised me with this speaker for Christmas and i was apprehensive at first. I am really blown away by my how great this speaker was compared to my charge 2. The only thing i would change is didnt include a wall adapter to the charging cord. So its stuck with USB only.  The sound quality is amazing and i didnt have to blast it (i like loud music) and my beloved charge 2 now sits in retirement on the shelf"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Top quality,5,This was a gift for my son who absolutely loves it! Good sound..great quality speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Beautiful, clear sound. Many genres of electronic music sound incredible on this speaker.",5,"Everything that I have listened to sounds absolutely beautiful! I am so happy with it. The music I know and love sounds even more amazing. The sound is so clear and I can hear each delightful sound! I mostly listen to electronic music and all the genres that I listen to have sounded incredible- house, techno, dubstep, riddim, experimental bass, melodic bass and world bass. The bass sounded really good! I saw some comments saying it wasn’t the best but for electronic music it seems to be great. Even the filthiest bass sounded fire. Also I love the coesn blue color."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,"The stereo sound from this speaker is amazing. The bass is great. The only negative is the battery life is not quite what the newer Flip has. So if that is important to you, go for the Flip 5. But the price is right on the Flip 4, and it is a great sounding speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super for relaxing,4,"Liked least. Price is not 74.00 for 2 speakers it’s 2 speakers nicely boxed in one box. A little misleading but price not unreasonable Liked most- used on a large screened in lanai installed where rain can blow in, the protection offered is more than adequate also the bass not overpowering, great for relaxing calm type of sounds."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Right for the price!,4,Great sound and price range is great when on sale.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent price and performance!,5,"Great price for the Flip 4. Performance is excellent. JBL never disappoints. In my opinion, JBL is the best sound quality out there. Will probably buy again for my son. This is our second JBL Bluetooth speaker. Best price I’ve found."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good value for the money.,4,Easy to connect to my iPhone. Decent bass but not as loud as I expected. Battery life is very good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes!!,5,"As soon as I turn it on it connects right to my phone which I absolutely love because I don’t have to go through settings and connect it everytime! The sound is amazing great for camping, small get togethers and whatever really!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great bluetooth speaker!,5,"I bought this for my husband's car. It doesn't have bluetooth and he really wanted to listen to audiobooks. We had different brand of speaker and it was never very good. It finally died and we got this one and it was a world of difference! The sound quality is amazing, connectivity is immediate, and it fits in his cupholder. Great purchase!!! Would highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I thought it would be louder,3,"Works great, easy to connect with, I was hoping for a louder speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker for the money,4,"Bought his for work - I facilitate classes in rooms from as small as a conference room to as big as a 200 person auditorium.  Worked right out of the box - no problems connecting with my laptop at all.  The sound is good - not high quality like my Bose I have for personal use, but good.  Not quite the range of highs and lows as my Bose.  Powerful enough to be heard in any size classroom.  Well worth the money if you are looking for a good quality speaker with decent battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a small place,5,Love this for travel and outdoor music. Works and sounds great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Favorite Bluetooth Speaker,5,This is my favorite speaker I have owned!  I use it mostly in my room or a living room to listen to music.  The quality is great and it is the perfect size and has a great volume range for general use.  I have had mine for a couple years and I've given them as gifts.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,Great product. Durable and good quality. Waterproof- perfect for using outside or at the pool. The battery lasts a long time and the sound quality is wonderful. The volume can go very loud without sacrificing the sound quality. Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect speaker for someone on the go,5,"This is everything you could want for a speaker of this size and price! Amazing sound quality and volume for such a small speaker and the battery life lasts about 2 days from my experience (and I use it quite often). My package didn't come with a charger for some reason, but amazon was quick to provide a solution so no worries! This is a perfect speaker for outdoor activities like camping or skateboarding and is incredibly convenient to carry around! Highly recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use and sounds great,5,"I am impressed with the sound this small speaker can produce. It is easy to connect to. It holds a charge well.A feature I didn't know it has is you can link several together, will be purchasing another in the future."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Only 4 hour battery life,4,"Sounds great, battery life is short"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW,5,"A friend at work had this and I Knew that I had to have it.  It is PHENOMINAL!!.  The sound quality is epic; the Bluetooth syncs up to my IPad is immediate and it is a solid product.  Good Job JBL, good job."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speakers,4,I absolutely love this speaker. Nice bass sound and plays loud enough to get the neighbors attention. Access to the charging port is a bit frustrating as the flap is not easily lifted.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy with this speaker,5,"The user of this device uses it a lot and has been really happy with it. She feels that the sound quality is good, especially when it is hanging.  She has had no trouble with connectivity nor any other technical issues in the 7 months that she has owned it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOUD! Perfect for college!,5,"My mother has the JBL Xtreme 2 so I already knew and loved the brand. However, that one is way too big for me to have in a college dorm. That’s why I went with this smaller one and I swear it basically carries the same strength! It gets super loud and has this surround sound effect to it. The music sounds so complete with this speaker and it’s the perfect portable size. 10/10!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is Awesome ??,5,"This thing is awesome.  Bought for a trip to Mexico originally and it was the best speaker at the pool.  Very loud, good bass and super easy to use.  I recently took it to my office to stay motivated with music during these slow covid 19 days.  People think I brought my home theatre in from down the hall.  They are shocked when they see my little speaker in the corner.  ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One of the Best Speakers,5,"I was going to get the JBL flip 5, because I already have a flip 4, but I got this one because of the multi connect feature, which is different for the flip 5. I really like the design of this speaker and its not super heavy so its easy to carry around. The sound quality is also amazing, and I really like the bass because its not overpowering, but is still able to be heard clearly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",All I can say is WOW!!!,5,The sound quality of this speaker is comparable to my home wired surround sound. Talk about clarity and high bass. I have this speaker in my office and have received compliments on both its looks and the sound. There is no distortion whether it is turned down low or turned up high and blasting. Bluetooth speakers have came a long way in the way they sound. You cannot go wrong with these speakers at all.**UPDATE**. My iPhone 6+ does not automatically pickup this speaker. I am hoping that Apple and JBL soon has a fix as this gets pretty annoying that whenever you get out of range of the speaker you have to go back and re select it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Simply amazed.,5,Very pleased. Chose the JBL because my grandson has a slightly bigger version and his sounds awesome. My smaller version is not far behind though. Used this speaker at the beach and very pleased with the sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",How do ya get it to work,4,"I’m old & not technology expert. This JBL came with no directions on how to operate the speaker, came with a “diagram” but that doesn’t help me at all! Very frustrating!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than the charge 3 in my opinion,4,"Fantastic bluetooth speaker, if youre torn between the charge three and the flip 4 (which i was for a long time). I can say that i had them play side by side and without a doubt the sound quality is better on the flip 4.  Now the charge 3 is a tiny bit louder and has more bass but in my opinion they dont outweigh how much clearer the flip 4 is.  Along with being more portable and more stylish (my opinion) i chose the flip 4.  The reason i give 4 stars is i have a samsung speakerbox pro same price which sounds better but not as portable and waterproof."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I needed!,5,"I love this speaker. It’s loud enough for a small-med get together and can also work in smaller settings.I had my kids bday party at an outdoor park pavillion, group of about 25-30 people and the sound was good!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL 4 love it!,5,"Purchased in October 2019, absolutely love it. Accidentally I've dropped the JBL a few times, its been submerged in water and still works like new. Was delivered on time, nicely packaged and came with everything needed for it. Sound quality is very good and gets pretty loud. Has a great battery life, Bluetooth connectivity/distance I would say is pretty good. Small, lightweight, and easy to transport."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Missing a key component,4,When I got the speaker it didn't come with a JBL charger cube but it did come with the  JBL charger cord
"JBL Flip 4, Black",very nice sound,5,Great little speaker!  Sounds great and good volume.  My grandson dipped it in our pool (to my dismay) just to prove it is waterproof and thankfully it is!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Loved it, hopefully you will as well!",5,"Probably the best cost benefit if you're looking for a good and ""cheap"" speaker. The price is actually very fair to its content. The sound is very clear and there is a well defined bass (it is not the strongest bass I've seen in a portable speaker)Overall the speaker feels very rough and strong. It is easy to pair and easy to use. The battery lasts what it promises. It is relatively loud (it fills the whole apartment where I live - but I'm a college student, so the apartment is not that big...)In summary, I loved it! The price is fair and the quality is awesome. I hope you'll love it as well!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Works well. Easy to set up. Sound is amazing. My only complaint is that I can't bluetooth to the TV. That is has to be hard wired. Otherwise it's a great speaker. Use a lot going to the beach! Sound quality is above average.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds Great, but has a hissing when idle and a bluetooth problem",3,"So it sounded great. Much better than my first BT speaker, Anker's Soundcore. Of course, this one is more than double the price and it did sound about twice as good. Unfortunately, it has a bit of a hiss when plugged into power and idle. I have the speaker on a little shelf at the head of my bed and listen at night if I wake up and can't go back to sleep so it is always plugged into power and always connected to Echo Spot. I really liked it and wanted perfection but if I didn't have something playing it would hiss and after a few days of being connected it would have a little click or actually more of a micropause very regularly every 3 or 4 seconds. It resolved with restarting the speaker, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure this part was the speaker's problem or Alexa's problem but since it also had the hiss, I had to return it. I know most people don't keep it connected and plugged in all the time so it may not be a problem if you regularly cycle the power and turn it off when not using it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound for a little speaker,5,Sounds great and pairs with other flip 4s and the JBL Boombox for awesome surround sound in the backyard
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome  sound last long time when fully  charged.Little.more.base.would make it.Super.Awesome.,4,I like everything  about it good sound from small speaker.Everyone always  complements  about the sound . I have ordered  4 total make good gifts.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a little speaker,5,I went to the store and tested about six different speakers of similar size and price. JBL won hands down. I own two and I recently bought one for my daughter and one for my father.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A Safe Purchase,4,"There are a few products out there that you buy understanding the associated risk. When it comes to portable speakers that make lofty claims in durability and sound quality, you have to be weary. When I purchased the JBL Flip 4, I fully understood this and expected average speakers with above average durability. I am glad to say that these speakers not only satisfy my standards, but they exceed them. The base is present and the sound quality is superb. The volume scales up nicely with an iPhone and never fails to deliver exactly what's promised, a durable crisp sounding portable speaker.Sound Clarity: 4/5Bass: 4/5Durability: 4/5Value: 4/5"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Purchased in June 2018, now it won't hold a charge",1,"I have owned this speaker, purchased on Amazon, for 2 years now, and as of last month, it will no longer hold a charge.  The battery life used to be excellent, I would rarely have to charge it with moderate use.  Now the speaker will only work if I keep it plugged in, very inconvenient, and even then, sometimes the speaker will start crackling and then randomly shut off.  If I turn it back on, it will work again.  I purchased this speaker over other brands as I have always had great luck with JBL and was a believer in their products so I paid the price premium for it.  Reading some other reviews, this seems to be a relatively common problem, which is completely unacceptable for something as simple as this.  I have other battery operated electronics that I have owned for 5, 10 years, etc that still work perfect.  NO EXCUSE FOR THIS JBL!!!  Others indicate they have called customer service to be told they are out of warranty and they won't help.  That is BS, especially given JBL should be aware that this speaker as a defect causing reduced life of the battery.  Let me also say this speaker has been babied by me.  It has never been in water, never even rained on.  It has ALWAYS been kept indoors in a climate controlled environment when not in use.  Very upset about this.  I will try contacting customer service and if they are willing to do anything, I will update my review.  As of now though, I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect For a Small Room!,5,"I utilize this speaker in my studio suite that is 135 Square Feet - It gives beautiful sound that isn't weak/echoey as some Bluetooth speakers can be.  The sound is rich and full, it also connects quickly and stays connected all throughout the day with ease.  I love that it can be portable, or stay connected to its power source for use!  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great bluetooth speaker with beautiful sound power!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No wall charger included......,5,"Seems to work well, only thing negative is that jbl dosnt include a wall charger, only a usb c cable, man i am glad i had old one or i'd be screwed, didnt say anything about needing charger on website.....just a heads up to all....."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Little Speaker,5,"Some toys you purchase in life turn out to be your favorites.  This little speaker has turned out to be one of those great toys.  So handy, portable and the sound quality from the little size is excellent meeting all of my needs.  Portability, small size, battery life and sound quality; I’m very impressed with my JBL Flip 4.  Would definitely purchase again should something happen to it.  Would also consider buying a larger one for all of the above reasons should the need for more sound arise."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery dies quick,3,Great speaker although mines been having issues where it dies in under 40 minutes :/
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best bluetooth ever.,5,This is the best bluetooth on the market... Only it is no longer on the market... Nav one of these awesome d vices whilst you still can... Price is very reasonable... Buttons placed better than flip 5 sound better than flip 5 and overall usage configuration is better than any UE bluetooth  piece...
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Worked for 14 months, and then ... it didn't.",1,"Bought this in April 2021, loved it for more than a year, using it as my primary speaker for my laptop.  Left it on all the time, and every time I fired up my laptop, the connection restored automatically.  Surprising sound quality for a speaker this size.  And then, a couple weeks ago ... it just stopped reliably connecting.  Sometimes it would connect just as it used to, but more often than not it (1) connects in ""voice"" mode only (but not the much richer ""music"" mode), so it sounds like crap; or (2) it says it's connected either in voice and music mode, or in music mode only, but either plays in the tinny voice mode only, or not at all.  I power off/on, and review/confirm settings in my laptop, and un-pair and re-pair, and nothing fixes it.  Wondering if others have had the same/similar problems after little more than a year of service?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money.,5,"I like everything about it. great sound, charge really quick, and battery last like 4 straight hours."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound in small package.,5,"Bought this for use on vacation. Used it at the beach on the ocean, as well as in our vacation rental playing music stored on my phone as well as Sirius through my phone. Amazing sound, including base for something so small."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,We love this speaker!  We primarily use it at the beach and sometimes at home. The sound quality is great!  Easy Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is good as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker,5,"Purchased this speaker to replace a Harman portable speaker I've used for the past couple of years. I was instantly amazed by how much of an upgrade this was. The battery life is excellent and the bass levels are perfect. I use this speaker in the bathroom when I'm getting ready in the morning, in the kitchen when I cooking, and even outside when I'm hanging out on the deck. This is money well spent."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Crazy sound,5,"Arrived fast, brand new, unopened. This little speaker packs a punch. Great highs, base and clarity. How much more can you ask for on such a small speaker. So far so good. Battery seems to be solid as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Quality and Price!,5,"I absolutely LOVE THIS SPEAKER! Great sound quality. Ideal and portable. I take it on my patio, in rooms just anywhere when I want to hear quality music or have something playing in my home office. Great quality and price!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker for its price and size,5,"I've been using this speaker for a month or so now. The radiators are absolutely powerful. This lil speaker packs a huge punch. Sometimes I would use it for long hours of studying and it'll last seemingly all day. As expected from reading other reviews, the cable that came with it has already gone faulty. Not a problem since I have plenty of micro usb cables. I recommend to charge the speaker from a computer since there has been known issues of the speaker's battery going faulty as well. The manual doesn't say anything about charging recommendations but the box likely came without a power adapter for reason."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,I like that I can use this for voice calls and that I can talk and work without having to hold something in my hand. It has great sound for a little speaker and is worth every penny!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Play music nonstop for several hours!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this speaker!,5,"All of the reviews that you read of this speaker that say it is great are true. It's nice and compact, water-safe which is just a nice added bonus because I would have bought it even if it weren't, very reliable connects via bluetooth (or you can use a cord if your device is not bluetooth enabled), and it simply puts out a nice, solid, well-rounded sound. LOTS of volume if that's what you want, but it can also play softly if that's what you want. My teen-age son commandeered the first one I bought so I just ordered another for myself. Buy this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",its meh! it works.. maybe for the clout,4,"i like this product i have been using it for over 6 months, the white one kinda gets a little bit dirty otherwise this is a product for one room use. I gave it four stars coz I think it's overhyped appearing as a cheaper alternative to the Charge 4. I think if you want to cover more than two rooms with good bass get the bigger one. enjoy the clout of JBL"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,I wanted something small with great sound. This covers both plus it's pretty loud. It has the ability for you to connect to more than one speaker so I plan to buy more.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice speaker,5,"“Small, portable enough to fit in the car.  A little too “bassy”” and not enough treble for my music listening tastes, but still a great sounding speaker, especially when listening to audio books. You can here every T D and k sound"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker works perfectly,5,"I keep this speaker in my golf bag. I don't have a cart mount, but it fits in a cup holder on my golf cart. Long battery life, great sound!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speakerphone sound quality much better than other brands,5,Jbl has much better sound quality with phone calls...often I have to repeat myself if I use my other non JBL speakers.  I switch back to the JBL and immediately I am told how much better I sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible sound for such a little speaker,5,"after watching many YouTube videos I decided to go ahead and purchase this little speaker and I’m really happy I did, the sound quality is incredible the battery life is good for what I use it for which is mainly for workouts and I only workout for about an hour so it’s not problem for me I also use it while playing video games to listen to music or YouTube videos but I can easily charge it from my pa4 in case the battery is low in conclusion I’m happy with my purchase and I think this is a great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,"My family has always used JBL products. This did not disappoint. This product is loud, durable and my favorite part is it connects to my phone as soon as I turn it on. The charging port didn’t work after about 8 months or so and I called them, sent in my old one and had another one delivered because it was still under the year warranty. Customer service was a breeze and no issues with the new one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",????,5,"Great speaker. It just sucks that it went $20 cheaper on the “deal of the day” like 4 days later, and Amazon doesn’t price adjust. I mean I could’ve just returned it, and then reorder it, but whatever"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound in Small Package!,5,Great for a beach day or when you need something way more powerful than your phone. Produces a crisp sound and good overall tones.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Que la entrega fue en tiempo record,5,Muy buena calidad del producto
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Power & bluetooth buttons,5,The red JBL Flip 4 worked at first but now the power won't come on unless I plug it in.  Then when I plug it in the bluetooth button doesn't work.  It won't turn on.  I have only used it a couple of times.  Can you tell me if I can get a replacement?Thank you very much for your understanding.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great things come in small packages!,5,I absolutely love this speaker. I purchased to use when we go camping. Our motorhome has an outdoor radio but you usually can’t get a station in the mountains. It sounds great and I have used it many times at home too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good with some flaws,4,"Great sound, although battery life could be better. I use it almost daily, yet to see anything majorly bad."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,"This thing not only sounds like a high-quality wireless speaker, it looks and feels like one too. The 12-hour battery life is more than enough. The bass is just enough without being overpowering, but is certainly present when it needs to be. Audio is clear at low and high volumes. Speaking of volume, this thing gets LOUD without compromising quality.  You really get what you pay for here. You can get a decent speaker for $20-30, but if you've got the budget and are looking for a really high quality, easily portable speaker, you can't go wrong with this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid Performance,5,Performed exactly as prescribed. Used on river raft trip. It got wet. No issues. Easy to connect via Bluetooth. Sound quality was solid for size and price. Good treble. Good bass. No complaints.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,"I use this for golf outings where I’m a hole sponsor, on the boat, in my backyard anywhere I don’t need a bulky sound system or a cord connectivity. Worth every penny!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","opening port is nearly impossible, sure to tear",2,"may 30-21the sound is great like jbl. The flip port is nearly impossible to open with a finger, prying soft plastic cover wont last long.The orange charge plug has bent , with little use. Cheap cord. tried to contact seller, no email on amazon website available.7/1/21- camo cover is pulling away from units edge ,No hdmi cable given but there is a port. For this price, youd think...10-9-21 charging port cover is torn, with gentle use... no seller response, called amazon rep who attempted to give me seller email since it is not provided on amazon website, told amazon rep, this didnt work as no response ever came, now it is out of watantee even though ive tried resolution since date of purchase. amazon did a one time replacement since seller never responded from date of receipt.11/2/22- unit finally would not hold a charge, so sad. This was the best sound while out on my +++ acreage. I will consider another purchase for christmas."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Solid performance in a portable Bluetooth speaker - sturdy construction, good sound",5,Great Bluetooth speaker.  Works exactly as advertised and as described by most viewers.  It is splash-proof for sure but I would still be uncomfortable submerging it even in a inch of water.  The sound is good enough for small outdoor parties.  It's not meant to replace high-end speaker systems.  It is portable and that's a big plus.  I really like that you can pair multiple devices and connect more than one to a phone or tablet so you get the same music in two places.  It's also good enough to work as an announcing system with the right app.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!!,5,We love this little speaker!  Super easy to connect.  The sound is incredible and just the right size to take with us or just have sitting on my desk!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Best $100 I’ve ever spent on a Bluetooth speaker, coming from a sound geek",5,"UPDATE: Still sounds brand new, keeps a charge for more then 2 days, but I’ve had trouble with the JBL connect+ because it wouldn’t connect with a JBL charge 3 so idk"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use anytime or place!,5,I love my speaker!  I substitute teach and when I do art lessons or silent reading I play classical music!  I can also use for children’s songs... students really enjoy it!  I also use it outside at home...plays anywhere!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,"I really like the look of the speaker and the sound is really good! It connects to the bluetooth, in my laptop, every single time. I bought a few of them. The problem I have with them is, they don't stay connected to each other when I daisy chain them. I have tried many, many times. Occasionally, they will stay connected for a little while but most of the time they don't. But as I said, the sound is really good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, not a fan of the JBL app.",4,The speaker itself is awesome. I have owned two and they have both been put through a good amount of abuse. The one thing I really dislike about them is how difficult it can be to connect multiple speakers at a time. I usually just use one of them because I hate having to go through the JBL app in order to connect them.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WaterPROOF,5,"This product is amazingly waterproof. We went on a kayaking trip and tied the speaker off to the kayak. When I got out of the kayak I had no idea but the speaker went underwater, the music was stopped before the speaker went under so I really had no clue. After hanging out for roughly 10 minutes and going to get back in I realized that the speaker was under and thought it was completely done. I picked it up and turned it right on like nothing happened. The sound quality is also amazing! Absolutely would buy again!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Very Nice,4,"super nice speaker actually really like it.  The only thing i wish is that i did my research and bought one with 360 sound.  That's not the speakers fault though.  The sound is explosive, I bought it in red and the red is beautiful, also the cord is really high quality for charging wish it came with an aux.  Would highly recommend this product.Update - 2 years later the speaker still turns on but after minimal use starts making really weird sounds when the bass hits.  loved this speaker sad to see it go"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic little speaker,5,"I ordered this in order to play music in my garage wood shop.  It connects seamlessly to my phone and does so immediately when I turn it on.  I used it also on my driveway this Halloween while enjoying games with the kiddos.  great sound, good bass, at a good price point."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy one or two,5,"I didn’t know I needed one until I got it. Now I am wondering why I did not get it earlier. Great sound, long battery life and much cheaper that another brand. So great we bought another one for the family."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works Great!,5,My son was very happy with it. It was a Christmas gift. It’s Loud!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome portable speaker,4,The speaker has performed excellent I actually bought two thinking I could mate them to play in chorus however I have not been successful in doing that because I am very low-tech I bought it to use on my motorcycle so rain would not bother it would be wonderful if someone could tell me how to get both speakers playing in chorus that would increase the value I think  however  because I am so low tech I would need detailed step-by-step instructions to get both speakers playing In chorus that happens when you are close to 60 years old and you missed the IT  boom. ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good little speaker.,5,Easy to set up and great sound.  I use it in my car to listen to audio books. So far I haven't had to recharge it and I've used it several times.  Love the case. Keeps it clean.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Durable,5,By far the best portable speaker I've ever gotten. 100% water proof. Great sound. Battery life for about 6/8 hours. Super easy to connect to Bluetooth as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best,5,excellent sound.  I have had the battery unused for up to two months and the charge remains.  I don't think there is a better one.  I recommend it 100%.  thanks to amazon who always has the best.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds great, decent bass for the size, connects easily, good battery life, water proof.",5,"This is a great speaker for a college student, it's great for t.v. watching on my laptop. Awesome for going hiking and water proof so I can listen to music in the shower !!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE!!,5,LOVE! We are now addicted to JBL speakers! Wehave 3 sizes and this Flip speaker makes our third JBL. We use them For Surround sound and use the waterproof one on our boat!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good.,5,"Easy set up, sounds good, and is very portable. I kind of wish it had a USB-C charging point to match the rest of my stuff, but that is a pretty minor point.I don't know about the durability or water resistence; I don't listen to music when I'm hiking or at the beach."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",my Daily driver,5,Awesome battery life!! The sound Quality it pretty good for its size and price. I have the last generation but I lost it. Great product and cover overall
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,5,"I got this after using my mom's for our outdoor wedding. We use this one in the garage to work out with. It's easy to connect, has a good base and great volume for something this size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not what I wanted great speaker though,5,"I loved this little speaker, sound was amazing for such a little speaker but was not compatible for party boost with other JBL speakers. I returned for a flip 5 to link with my charge 5."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Clear sound,5,Greta quality and clear sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Paired with my other flip 4 playing stereo with jbl app.  Play them at least 9 hours a week during our 3 times a week league pool games.  Everybody loves the sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful sound with long charging life.,5,"Was and still very impressed with the sound, the long life of a charge. A lot more than I expected."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good qualit,5,I had one of these at home and used to travel with it back and forth to our cottage. I got a second one for the cottage as they have qood quality at a reasonable price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small stuff with loud volume,5,"Like title it is very loud and clear, I had boss before and I didn't like anything about it. It's not my type. Of course it's connect to device pretty fast and I got it cheaper from Amazon it was like $63.00"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s amazing,5,It’s very powerful and the sound quality is amazing but it took some time for my family to love it now my sister takes it every day from me and my mom plays will you be there by Michael Jackson in the car
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds very good,5,I love and now  my husband wants one to
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker distorted after playing one song,2,"The speaker started to crap out after playing the first song, vibration coming from inside the speaker driver.  I can’t say I can recommend this product. However due to so many positive reviews, I will order a replacement and report back."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No charger.,4,"Didn’t come with a charger, probably used/ refurbished and not new out the box. The sting was attached to speaker already which is usually not the case if it’s brand new.  Functional, but not brand new, will see how well it does before returning it if needed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good enough, and long battery life.",5,"My friend has the bigger version I don’t know the model name, I figured this should be as good , and I was wrong. Obviously it’s smaller so it won’t be as loud , but it’s not bad at all though, I just wished it had more of a stronger bass kick. Other than that I like it , it works, portable, and good enough. Long battery life!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Small form factor, large room filling sound.",5,"Just got my JBL Flip 4. Oh my dose it have great sound quality! For its size it is amazing! Surprised when connected with the JBL connect app it downloads firmware updates. True lots of devices do this but wirelessly from your connected device? Thought that was a cool feature. At this point I would recommend it to anyone needing a small form factor Bluetooth speaker with room filling sound. Rap, classic rock, classical, I have tried it all and sound is awesome!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a terrific speaker for the price,5,Just took this to Mexico so I could play my music. Quality of sound is very good. It is light enough to easily pack and it made my cocktail parties a big success. Very easy to connect and price is so reasonable. I looked at lots of options but didn’t want to spend more than $100 and after reviewing the reviews I decided to take a chance and I am really happy with this choice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Winner,5,"I've been shopping around for a portable speaker a while. In the past I've bought the cheaper ones from like Ross/TJ Maxx and those never lasted long or performed how I needed them to. JBL 4 caught my eye because I didn't want to spend more than $100 for a speaker but I also wanted it to be good for days at the beach or small get togethers at home.  It's been about a month now and I couldn't be happier. This is the best in the market if you're looking for sound quality, battery life, and volume 10/10 recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not user friendly,1,I actually have an oontz speaker which I liked but they are all defective after a few months where the charging ports stop working. I got a replacement which also broke so I tried this speaker. First I really don’t like that you can’t see the battery percent on this JBL speaker. There’s a area that has 4 lights that lights up when you turn the speaker on. This shows you the battery percent but only when you turn the speaker on. So if you’re playing the speaker for hours you won’t know the battery percent unless you turn speaker off then on. On the oontz you can look on your iPhone and see battery percentage and it also has the little earphone on the top of phone showing that it’s connected to your speaker. On the jbl nothing will show on your phone that you’re connected to the speaker. Also I like use the Bluetooth to listen to a audio book as I go to sleep. I like the volume low on my speaker while having the volume for iPhone alarm loud so I can wake up on time. With the jbl speaker the volume for everything on your phone is connected to the speaker. So if you have the speaker volume low that means your phone alarm and ringer is the same volume. I’ve gone into my iPhone to see if there was something that could be done but my settings on sound: change volume with buttons was off. Meaning that anything connected should not affect my phone volume settings. So this speaker is really not user friendly. I’m returning this and trying a more expensive oontz with a 2 year protection plan. Fingers crossed.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not that long of a life...,3,"They advertise that the battery lasts for 12 hours. It will probably do this on a very low volume. The reason for 3 stars and not one is because it has good quality at high volumes and doesn't distort too much. But if you have a lot of bass you will start to hear distortion. I use it for snowboarding so I had it on high volume and it lasted about 3 to maybe 4 hours before dying.SUMMARY: Will last on very low volume, but if you want high output, expect 3 hours before needing to recharge"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Price and quality versus Flip 5,5,"Really well build quality speaker, at a great price versus the flip 5, and has voice assistant. You can also answer calls, which is awesome, I really recommend it. Works perfect for my Microsoft Surface Pro and with my cell phone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound quality but sometimes just randomly shuts off.,4,Good sound quality but sometimes just randomly shuts off.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Great product standing for its name.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice bluetooth speaker.,5,Good quality speaker . nice sound. Fairly loud for size. Only problem i see is not compadible with newer versions of speakers. Can't pare 2 different models.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof!,5,Sound quality is good! We use it all the time outside while doing yard work or by the pool. We take it fishing with no worries about getting it damaged from water. Seems  durable. We have enjoyed this purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Beautiful, strong sound. Easy connect to bluetooth."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Sound Quality!,5,"This is my Second JBL speaker. My first, a JBL Flip 3 lasted 5 years before the charging port finally gave out. I really love these speakers and I will never buy anything else."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud!!,5,I’m enjoying this little gem... it has good sound and connects quickly to my Bluetooth... I use it on my ranger and the campgrounds.. battery last a long time and is easily chargeable...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,5,"They're sturdy, great JBL sound. I like that they're symmetrical, so it doesn't necessarily matter what side is up. I haven't tested the waterproof-ness, but they are built well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Enjoying the Speaker,4,I like the size and shape.  Could have a more rounded base for stability.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound in a little speaker.,5,Love the sound and looks of it.Small enough to take on our golf cart and enjoy music or to the pool because being waterproof.When it’s loud it’s crystal clear.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound quality!,5,This speaker is amazing. It holds charge for a really long time 12-18 hours play time. Sound quality is great. This is really loud. It works great outside and since it is waterproof you don’t have to worry if it rains.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker so much,5,"I LOVE this little speaker! The sound is great, I use inside and outside.  I left it in the rain all day by accident and it lived up to its waterproofness."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for phone conferences and music.,4,"Sounds great, but not very loud.  Works fantastic as a speakerphone.  I've been told I sound better using this than my phone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's Worth it!,5,"At first, I was a little skeptical about it but when I unboxed it and connect it to my phone...My heart just dropped from how powerful the bass was. The sound quality is amazing. I'm really thinking about buying another one soon."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny,5,"This little thing is amazing,  the sound quality from that little box is great. The battery last surprisingly long and the fact that it's portable and small we take it every where we go. Great buy"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I definitely recommend,5,Does what it says it does. Great sound for a small speaker. It feels and seems very durable and high quality. Battery lasted long.  Brought it to the beach for a week and was perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth Speaker - Even Dry!,5,Just received my JBL Flip 4 and I love the sound it produces on my lanai. Unlike other reviewers I don’t plan to put it in my pool or dance around in rain with it so ...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy ??,5,The speaker got here fast. Sound is great and still haven't had to charge yet. But I don't use it that often either. It was a great buy for the buck. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,I purchased this speaker to travel with and it has amazed me ever since. I was at a family reunion in an open park  and turned this speaker on and was able to hear it  clearly 100 yards away. Everyone loved the sound and the battery life was forever. I'm purchase a second one as we speak so can sync the two. I would definitely recommend!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker for on the go.,5,"This is a decent speaker, I don’t really have much to compare it to. I use it at home, at the gym and sometimes outside. It gets pretty loud but I have rarely ever turned it all the way up.The sound is good and battery life as well. I haven’t had any problems with connectivity. This thing is pretty sturdy and has been dropped or fallen from a pretty good distance.I haven’t tried any other speakers and this one gets the job done when I don’t want or can’t wear headphones."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing quality. Compact size perfect for travel,5,Got this as a birthday gift. Great choice. Volume is amazing and battery lasts quite a while. I haven’t tried the waterproof option just cause I’m scared to do it the wrong way!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life has not good,3,"I was very disappointed to find out that the battery life on this speaker is pretty terrible. I like to carry the speaker around with me as I’m cleaning and was frustrated a few different times with how fast the battery will die and just disconnect on me. This is super unfortunate given the price point. On the upside the turquoise color is cute, and the sound is pretty good, but that’s about it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",NO SOUND 2 months later connects Bluetooth has power,4,"update: manufacturer warranty covered with no questions.I got this thinking it would last as it's really durable and waterproof. Two months later I go to use it  and no sounds works. I can pair the device change the volume on the speaker up see it change on my phone, play, pause; you get it's connected. There is enough battery even the sound on turning it on makes a small chirp other than the normal sound it does. This thing sat around and then didn't work when we wanted it to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm satisfied,4,"I live for my music, so I'm happy that this speaker has so much more bass than my old one. I just wish it were a bit louder. Sometimes it can sound a bit muffled, which works better for some songs than others."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound in a small source,5,"Daughter bought this for her husband and he loves it. He uses it during yard work, and playing basketball, or other outdoor activities. Hasn't been water tested just yet, but so far so great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!,5,"I was debating spending the money vs just using my little cheap bluetooth I already had. I should have bought this sooner. It has great sound, great bass, and is indeed waterproof. I use it while golfing, in the shower, while cleaning and everything! If you have more money than I do or have friends with these speakers you can hook them all up together and blast the tunes! Oh, also, the connection process is the easiest ever. Now I just click the button, it connects in about 2 seconds, and we are jamming!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Amazing desing and quality, but one flaw.",5,"This is probobly the best mid range speaker of 2017, I love the sound quality, and the designs. The only bad thing is when unboxing it if you don't know what to expect the charger and manual may be thrown out, because they are kind of hidden in two smaller matte and glossy black boxes at the top and front of the inside of the box, but. Any thing aside from that is a 11 out of 10, the ipx7 waterproofing is amazing, it has a nice easy grip to it and a flawless design. I hoped this helped, and I say you should DEFINITELY buy this speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Compactability,4,I am impressed with the quality of sound and the performance level: bluetooth connectivity and battery life time will tell.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No complaints,5,Keeps a good charge for hrs. Good size for motorcyclist to keep in Saddle bag. Comes in handy for tailgate parties. But I use it the most in the garage... works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Little Bluetooth Speaker,5,Very cool and typical JBL quality. Great sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Classic jbl,5,"With a stunning 12 hour battery life, I say that the jbl flip 4 is the best medium sized Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is just as good as my friends 100 dollar charge 3. The Bluetooth connectivity range is about 20 feet which is alright"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really good sound!,5,"This is the second flip 4 I’ve purchased.My music therapist wife liked the sound so much from the first one she claimed it as her own.So, now this one is mine.  ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,4,Great speaker for the money. Only gave it 4 stars because the speaker doesnt hold a charge for as long as I would expect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product.,5,This speaker is great for the price. The audio is good and the battery life is great. I have brought it in the shower a couple times now and it works wonderfully.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,"Love the product, easy to use, sound quality is fantastic and I like the way it looks."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker.,5,I have two of these and they are just right for my needs. Listen to podcasts at work and a fully charged Flip 4 lasts at least 8 and sometimes 10 hours.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Quality,5,"Connecting it to a blue tooth device was easy! The sound quality melted my heart so much, I gave this one to my wife and bought another color for myself. My new favorite portable speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","An Awesome, Affordable Speaker For Music Lovers!",5,"Figuring I needed an upgrade from the 
AmazonBasics Wireless Bluetooth Dual 3W Speaker with Built-in Microphone - Blue
 I bought on Black Friday, I bought this JBL Flip 4 after reading very good reviews on several tech sites. I am not disappointed one bit. Right out of the box, this speaker feels like a quality product. It paired with my iPhone 6S+ with no issues and the sound quality is quite amazing for a speaker in this price range. I've always been satisfied with JBL's car audio products and as a daily music listener, I am very glad I invested in this great speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","A very good asset, excellent sound",5,Good design and good sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Amazing quality, even better price!",5,"Bought this speaker about a month ago, been using it daily since then.. After walking into multiple stores I concluded that this was the best BT speaker for the price and I've been really happy with my decision!I take this bad boy everywhere, in the shower, kitchen while I'm cooking.. I love how small and light it is, bought a case for 10$ and it's perfect. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a portable speaker in the 80-90$ price range as this speaker is easily better quality than most of the 130$+ portables out there. 10/10 no complaints yet!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good, but annoying sound when turned on/off",4,"This speaker has great sound, but the battery life isn’t the greatest. Not 12 hours.  The only thing I don’t like about this speaker is the annoying loud sound that plays when you turn it on/off. Especially when all you’re doing is listening to calming music, when you shut it off there’s a loud sound that plays to let you know it’s shutting off. Really? Is that necessary? It’s always the same volume too, regardless of how low you’re listening to music. Other than that, good quality product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A review from a true audiofile,5,"I think this speaker is absolutely fantastic sound quality wise. It has a very detailed high frequency 's, well pronounced mid frequency's, and deep bass going down to 50hz. To my surprise there is some sound stage from this little guy. Once you receive this speaker you might be caught by surprise with how heavy it is for its size, it comes in at 1.35 pounds! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I would give it 4.9 stars only because the stitching of the grill could be a little better. If anyone is wondering in the box it comes with the speaker, micro USB charger cord, and manual's and warranty information. This concludes my review."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery ugh,4,Battery doesn't last but 7 hrs even though it says 12
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL FLiP 4,4,Good value.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Compact, Good Sound, Good Price",4,"I love this speaker. The sound is fantastic, especially for its size. And it’s loud enough for many different environments. It was easy to set up the Bluetooth connection.  This is the second one of these speakers that I have purchased. I loved the first one so much that wanted to try paring a second.  I can’t wait to try."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Pound for Pound Champion!!,5,"We have had this speaker pool side, at the beach, in the car, in the boat, outside at the Bbq picnic table and everywhere else (the bathroom) my teenagers feel the need to listen to whatever it is they call music these days. When I get a chance to throw on some Classic Rock the JBL Flip 4 has an AWESOME sound to it. It sounds good with that other music as well. Pound for Pound it is the best speaker at a very reasonable price. If your looking to buy, look no more, pick the color that suits you and click the add to cart button!! You will not be disappointed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can be used as a speaker!,5,Great experience so far. I was using it litterally less than 30 seconds after opening it.Arrives chargedEasy to connectIt's a little weird that it uses the microUSB connector still instead of USB-typeC But not a problem.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disapointed,3,"For those considering this over hyped product; this particular example is adequate to listen to low levels (easy to talk over in a medium quiet voice) background music, at distances of arm length or more from the speaker; AFTER the painfully bright high frequencies (above 1K Hz) have been equalized own from 1 to 3 on a Samsung phone equalizer display.The Samsung phone volume is at 9-10.The volume is one step down from max on this flip4 (and conversations can be carried out in a medium quiet conversational voice.)After close examination (without disassembly) this unit does not appear to be a knock off (based on JBL's information on how to spot a knockoff).NOT FOR CRITICAL LISTENING; very casual & moderate level (background) listening only...consider it as an improved, rechargeable 1960's transistor radio- audio is quality is roughly old table radio quality (with much less hum/noise), a bit better low midrange reproduction and very peaky upper midrange and highs that get peaky-er and more annoying as the volume level is increased.Hope this helps prevent someone else from being burned!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good sound quality but...,4,"I like the quality sound.  What I don't like is that turning it on and off, it makes a loud sound.  You cannot pair two bluetooth device to this when each of them within range of the speaker.  I did (my computer and my phone), and it shuts off my itself every 10 minutes or so.  Once I unpaired  from my computer, it works fine.  Or the computer is not within range (like when I take it to work and pair with my phone only), then it's fine."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Tiny powerhouse,5,"This unit has great sound for it's size. I'm very pleased with it. I use it when I teach my self-defense/martial arts classes and it fills up the room on just 50%. The bluetooth effortlessly connects and you're up and running in about a minute. Play, pause, skip, volume up, down, etc all work easily off your phone's music player. Your calls and videos you play on your phone have crisp audio, as well.I cannot attest to the waterproof claims, however, as I only use it indoors in a climate controlled environment."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing little guy with awesome sound!,5,"This little thing is awesome!  Not being an audiophile and getting into ranges, etc...it just sounds great.  We use it on the patio, at the camper, in our golf cart and at the lake and don’t have to worry about the weather or where to sit it, because it’s small enough to sit anywhere and still give great sound,  plays for hours before needing a charge and loud enough that it has to be turned down sometimes ??....add a hard sided clamshell case(probably in your “customers also viewed” scroll down there ?? for added protection while transporting and you’ll be taking it everywhere with you."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good sound, waterproof, no skip buttons.",4,"I use it by the shower since it is waterproof.  It works very nicely and sounds pretty good for such a small speaker.  I feel like the battery life isn’t as long as it’s supposed to be, but that’s not such a big deal to me.  I do wish it had buttons on it that would allow skipping to the next song, so that I don’t have to touch my phone when wet (although it’s waterproof too, I try not to).  It only has volume buttons, play/stop, and a Bluetooth button."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"Great sound from a small speaker! This is our second one. We use it daily and typically charge it every other day. After about 20 months, the battery needed replacement but it was so difficult to change that we just bought a new one since the price is reasonable. Great color choices."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfied!,5,Good size. Good weight. Good sound. Everything I was looking for.It would be nice if it had a clip instead of just a string strap. But I added a small carabiner and it’s perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING sound,5,"Battery life is great, sound quality is unbelievable for such a small speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,5,I first heard one of these at an outdoor brewery. The sound quality is amazing! Hurried to Amazon and bought one. This works great in our golf cart and on the patio. You can link them together to cover large areas too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",awesome speaker,5,"wasnt expecting such good sound quality out of a little speaker. great highs and lows and super clear. Boat this to use on my sailboat and can hear it perfect while its in the cabin. Paired up easily to my phone and ipad and i love the buttons on the top. You can submerge this speaker under water and it keeps playing like normal, also feels very rigid. over all just a really good well rounded speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It is extremely durable,5,I took this to the Virgin islands and I brought it to the beach one day at the end of the day I set on top of the car I got into the car we drove away I forgot it was on top of the car we took a shrimp turn we heard something fall off the top of the car approximately quarter mile down the road I found it had a small dent in it but it works like it's brand new and I love it and I am really glad it's so durable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful little speaker,5,"To start, I am not a connoisseur of speakers. However, I have purchased the model before this one for my daughter, and then for a friend, and finally I got the waterproof one for myself. I really love it. It connects easily and has great sound. The phone calls work so-so, but good enough."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!,5,One of the best speakers I’ve bought. Definitely awesome and you can connect multiple ones for a surround sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice but not as good as the charge 2+,3,"I got this for my husband to take on business trips, because I’ve had a JBL Charge 2+ for years (which is AMAZING) thinking any newer version would be just as good, if not better. It’s a decent little speaker, works great, battery life is awesome, but as far as sound quality, it’s like 12 steps below my charge 2+ so it just wasn’t for us. Definitely personal preference but we didn’t like it at all, and ended up finding a used charge 2+ for him. I did not return this, and will just gift it to someone for Christmas as it is very nice, plus my husband threw the box away.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buen articulo,4,"Buena calidad, suena muy bien y además es un producto duradero. Lo tengo hace un año p más y suena como la primera vez que lo use."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,"I've had this well over a year, still works the same, very nice speaker, has a nice sound and weight to it. The bass is lacking a little bit, but I definitely recommend this, it's the best portable speaker I've purchased. The battery life is pretty bad though, it won't last you more than an hour or two on full volume. The sound fills up a car perfectly, and if outside, the sound carries quite nicely.  I have not tested the waterproofing or durability of the speaker, as I don't have money to throw around."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works wonders,5,"I bought this for my dorm to drown out the weeps coming from the other students who over estimated their work ability in the first quarter of school. However, I have seemed to do that as well and now use it to drown my weeps and cries from my fellow floor mates. Overall, it is worth the price as on the weekends when my dorm building is having music wars (trying to see who can play their music the loudest), I am often the champ."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes,5,I love this speaker to me it packs a punch also you can pair it to Alexa battery life isn't bad but I only use it for a few hours a day not a heavy user
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A great speaker,5,"Paired up with a Charge 3 is the ticket, this little speaker cleans it right up for an unreal sound with the deeper base of the Charge 3. Stand alone this little speaker can handle its own nicely and actually a little cleaner than the Charge 3 at lower volumes with plenty of base, paired up you get an unreal experience. I actually like this little speaker on its own better than the Charge 3 in smaller rooms, but the three stands out in larger rooms at medium volume??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Experience,5,"I love this speaker not it's waterproof, a good size, but it's amazingly loud. I done had a lot speakers in my life but this JBL Speaker takes the crown. The Bluetooth connectivity it's simple and easy.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Connectivity is good, the sound is great",5,"This bluetooth speaker has met and maybe even exceeded my expectations.  It works exactly as I expected.  Connectivity is good, the sound is great, each charge lasts a long time, etc.  I have not immersed it in water or used it in the shower, so I can't speak to that.  I bought two of these speakers, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.  When I ordered the two speakers, I ordered both in grey, however, I received black.  I notified the seller and was given a 20% discount on each speaker.  I am quite satisfied with these speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,5,Good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just perfect,5,It paired quickly to wireless. The sound is really good and battery life outstanding. I have a boneyard of wireless speakers that can now stay there. Best purchase this year.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money!,5,"I love this speaker. For its size, the sound is great! It can get very loud and the sound is still very clear. I love listening to music with this in the shower or at the beach. It connects to my phone automatically once I turn it on, making it super easy to just play music & go. It also lasts a while (as long as you aren’t blasting at full volume). For the price, I highly recommend it if you want a small but loud speaker. JBL is a great brand."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING,5,The sound and durability is amazing. You can take this speaker with you anywhere even to the park to listen to music. The speakers are loud but with an amazing bass and rich sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charger doesn't work,3,I had a panic attack after one use after after week.Plug it up to play while charging it kept going back off.  Switch sockets still wouldn't work. Use another plug and it start working. week. See how it goes...because I will be sending it back
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Everything is perfect,5,Nice carrying size speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Son loves it!,5,Gave them as a gift and my son loves it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a small speaker,5,This is my second flip4. The sound is great and easy to connect. I use it daily for music at work. Be sure to run the battery down all the way before charging so it lasts!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,4,"I purchased this for my adult daughter, she loves it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",And i'm so glad i chose this over the new BOSE speaker,5,"I have been wanting a JBL Flip speaker since June of last year, but couldn't bring myself to spend $120 on something for just me. But once i saw that the price lowered to $80, i couldn't pass it up!! And i'm so glad i chose this over the new BOSE speaker. I have an older BOSE speaker that was purchased in 2013, and this is just as good if not better. Especially considering it's water proof, and smaller in size than my BOSE. I've already recommended this to my friends as well as family members! Can't wait to purchase a second one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",ON/OFF button failed after 2.5 years of mild use,1,"I purchased this JBL Flip4 Speaker after it was recommended by a friend who loved it.  I'm a quiet household person, but when I wanted to listen to a meditation, podcast or a bit of music, I would use this speaker with delight.  It had a full sound range, was easy to use and the portability great.  Until 2 years after my purchase started crackling and automatically shut off.  Then the ON/OFF button failed.  The speaker is now not functional.  I thought JBL was a reputable company, so I called customer service to see if there is anything they could do.  Basically, after the one year warranty, the company doesn't cover the product at all.  I owned JBL large speakers in the past that were rated high on Consumer Report.  They were a good solid product and lasted well.  NOT ANYMORE given this experience.  I will not buy from them again if at all possible and I will share my experience with their product widely.  I don't want others to waste their money and end up polluting the planet with electronic equipment.  I want want flowers in my backyard, not broken electronics!  I hope you'll find this helpful when choosing to buy this product.  CANNOT RECOMMEND."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,"Great product, haven’t had any problems with it so far. Sound is great, pretty loud for the size, definitely recommend if you’re not trying to break your bank."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it,5,Tried the anker speaker for $27 and returned it. don’t waste your time. Spend a little more and get this it’s well worth it. The sound and bass are way above all in the price range.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it.,5,"I use this everyday to listen to audiobooks and sometimes music on my way to work, while at work, and in my garage at home.  I have had it about 4 1/2 months now.  I charge it every 2 or 3 days.  Battery life is excellent at 10-12 hours on a full charge, depending on volume.  I like that the cylinder shape fits in the cupholder of my car.  It has  suprisingly good bass for it's size.  I have no complaints about the purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect speaker for any adventure,5,"This speaker is awesome!  I take it camping, snowboarding in my backpack bumpin toons all day long!  Sounds amazingly loud with deep bass for the size of the unit. Connecting to my phone was super easy.  10/10 would buy again"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding,5,These speakers are awesome. I usually listen to them for 10-20 mi utes in the morning and while i shower at night. I can get at least 8-10 days out of them on a charge with that routine.  Purchased two and setting them up for the right and left speaker stereo use is a breeze with the JBL app. The JBL app does take up quite a bit of space....but that's my only complaint with that side of things. These speakers look and feel of great quality and the sound itself is exceptional. Definitely better than I expected in all aspects.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it ??,5,Omg I love this speaker I had it for 2 years and dropped it alot ?? it did break (over time bc of clumsiness) I could take it into the shower and everything. SO so worth itt
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for a great price,5,I have owned portable speakers for years now - we love to go to the pool and to the beach with them. Many have claimed to be waterproof and all have claimed to have great sound. Most fail on one or both of those claims. I did my research and purchased this bad boy. This thing not only sounds fantastic for its purposes but is truly waterproof and incredibly easy to control. I place it by the pool and control my music with my Apple Watch. It is loud and perfect for crowded outdoor uses. It also isn’t bad to look at.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud and good charge,5,Battery seems to last very long. I play it in the office at the lowest volume and it’s super loud which is good. I play it for 3 days in a row around 3-4 hours and it still had 3 out of 5 lights in battery charge which is really good. I’ve yet to see it die. It makes this sound effect every time you turn it on and off which could be loud and bothersome but it’s fine. I use my android charger and it charges just as good as the one they give you.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,4,"Great speaker, first one was DOA so returned, second one had blemish in front on the material cover.  So minus 1 star.Most importantly the sound is great.  Also, it feels like quality, and easy setup and controls.  Received call and used as speaker phone on my first outing with it.  Asked person on other end how my voice was and it was fine.  I was holding the speaker a couple a feet away from my face.Glad I returned the Amazon Tap and got this.  The Tap was nothing but frustration."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth your money.,5,Worth your money. Powerful speaker. Like the fact that is water proof. It's small perfect for a day in the beach park kayaking etc. 100% satisfied with this speaker. Arrive in 2 days and in perfect condition.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Crazy cool,5,
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 is a very good speaker.,5,"Delivery was lightening speed, ordered at night, delivered the next afternoon.  So far, I’m very happy with the battery life.  I’ve been playing in low to mid volume for 10 hours, the battery indicator still has 3 bars.  Sound quality is good for the size of the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounding Speaker.,4,The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is cause you can change the song on the speaker. You have to change it on the device you are listing on. Other then that the sound is great and very loud if you turn it up all the way. The bass is not as loud as I would like it but you can tell its there. Over all I do like the speaker except the part were you can not change the song on the speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Premium sound!,5,This product is amazing. I wanted to upgrade from my last speaker the oontz angle 3 and I'm really happy with my decision! Immediately after trying it I could tell the difference in sound quality. There's way more bass and the sound is just better overall. I chose the red because I'm in the Christmas spirit and the vibrant color matches my decor perfectly. Can't wait to show off this speaker to people who visit for the holidays ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black","JBL well known for there speakers, know your speakers",5,"I have only used it one day, so I am limited to what I can say about it. Great sound, seems to be well made - it not a little lite speaker.  Valve?  Not sure yet - only used one day..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",more treble than bass,5,good sound  needs more bass but  Im keeping it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Used for Golf,5,"I got the Flip 4 because it fits in the cup holder of the golf cart, has enough bass to make the music sound great plus,  is loud enough but, not loud enough to be annoying on the course."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,"Have it for a week. So far so good. Mainly used for work from home (play music, conference call, etc).We will see whether the battery will hold up."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great to have around just bad battery life.,5,Sound quality and connectivity are great. The battery life isn't great. In fact at low battery while plugged in it dies eventually. Can't listen it on the charger. I still enjoy it though.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is great,5,"I am not one usually to write reviews - but I am madly in love with this little speaker. I have it plugged in on my desk at work, and its just been fantastic. Great sound quality. Zero complaints. (Also, the ends vibrate when music is being played, which is a really cool feeling)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speakers!,5,These speakers are great! I loved the first one so much I bought a second. I sync them and play them out in my backyard as we swim or work. Can’t be beat!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Standby for the sound,5,"Great product, sound is extremely well for this little device.  It sounds like a real stereo system.  Easily transportable, light weight and holds a charge.  Great for any trip!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent! Thank you.,5,Very pleased with this purchase. Thank you so much.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny,5,I have had many Bluetooth speakers over the years but I have to say this one is the best I’ve not only purchased but just came across in general. The sound quality is amazing and you can really hear the base. Very easy connection and the battery life last quite awhile.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",EXCELLENT speaker – great for outdoors and indoors!,5,"Honestly, this speaker is awesome. Took this on a recent beach vacation and it was a huge hit. Could hear the music perfectly outside (despite the loud ocean waves in the background), and everyone was able to connect to it easily. Having it near the sand wasn’t an issue either. Very easy to tuck away in a bag – not super heavy like speakers I’ve had in the past. Whether we were hanging at the beach or playing a game of cards inside, this speaker worked perfectly. Highly, highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It got a nice bass yo it and I love the loudest,5,It greeattttt
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for the price but not great battery life,3,I've always wanted a JBL speaker and this was the cheapest one I found. It has great sound quality and base. My only gripe with it is the battery life is not that good. When you have the volume turned all the way up It doesn't last for more than an hour and a half. I've had different speakers and have the volume up high and the battery would always last until the next day. With this one I suggest you keep it on the charger take it off if need be but keep the plug nearby.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The perfect speaker!,5,This is exactly what I was looking for. Great sound at the perfect price point.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof Beach proof LifeProof cannot wait to put it through its paces.,5,Received it in less than a day. Opened it up around 1 a.m. start playing music at 6 a.m. so I didn't wake the wife. Sound quality is very good the Bluetooth distance went throughout the house and upstairs through many walls. I can't get technical that is not me. Great price great sound and the fact I can link it with more flip fours in the future makes me happy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",easy to use,5,"Great base, high, and mid tones. Excellent volume and sound. Have had it for a little over a month and use it almost every day. Has only required a recharge once three days ago."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente compra original,5,El sonido excelente la batería duradera todo 100% original
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive sound and easy to use,5,This bluetooth speaker is easy to connect and the sound is very good considering its small size. It works perfectly fine without an app and will not depend on app support over the coming years.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will not take or hold a charge after the initial time it was used.,5,The battery will not take a charge. We only used it once and now it's useless. We have tried different cords etc. We just want a speaker that works.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great for personal use, EDIT!",5,"This speaker is perfect for my intended use, which is music for me, in the shower, on the deck, in the manshack.  It's very rich and clear in these settings.  It's probably not what I'd want if my purpose was to rock a room full of people at a party.Not a super big deal, but I've learned that if played at volume, it can shut down even if plugged in."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Sound quality is amazing even when very low ! The size is perfect its not to big not to small just the right size! I was going to get next size up but im glad I didn’t! I would recommend this product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Has pretty good sound with good bass,5,"Bought for my daughter. She dropped it in the tub when taking a bath one day. Still works. Has pretty good sound with good bass. Daughter loves the mint color of this one. Plan on getting her the carry case for it soon. Only one thing I can say is iffy. My daughter knocked it off her table (yes she's a bit clumsy) while it was plugged in and the charge cable broke. These use pretty standard cables so we were able to find another one that charges. Overall though, pleased with the quality of this speaker. Trusted brand. Would buy another one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waste of money,5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance to take with him when he goes golfing. He used it exactly 1 time and it won’t even turn on. What a waste of money. Would not recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,Great sound quality!! Highly recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW!!!,5,"I have been using older technology for years.  I decided to upgrade and I settled for this bad boy.  WOW!!  Very rich sound, very LOUD sound according to my wife.  It connected easily and I'm really enjoying this.  Highly recommended."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hubby loves it!,5,My husband enjoys listening to music while he’s working in his shop or man cave. He loves this speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",FINALY,5,My son has a different model. So we knew what to expect.Based on MUDDLED FUDDLED REVIEWS on other speakers I purchased some lesser priced alternatives.Wanted a cheap version for my shop. My CLIP 2 which is MONO sounds way way better than the budget highly rated.Thank you for easy Amazon no fuss Prime returns!!!!!!I am sticking with JBL models in the future.My son has purchase two more JBL in order to link them together (Pricier models than previous and he also has a Clip 2 for travel.)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great outdoors but..,4,"Sounds amazing outdoors especially by a wall, but sounds muddy indoors for some reason. Don’t understand why."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",perfect,5,"I love this speaker, my work truck is a loud diesel I can hear this speaker perfectly. Water proof, the battery probably last a couple hours but I keep it plugged in still I love this speaker worth it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker for the price!!,5,There was not much to dislike about this product. I've always wanted a really good Bluetooth speaker and this is the one to get. Good Bass with the resinater on the sides. Also has a bass boosted mode cant remember how to turn it on tho. Good crisp highs. It does crackle a little at really high volumes but not a big deal to me but. Also water proof so you don't have to worry about it around water which is nice. I would highly recommend any thing from JBL.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 is a winner,5,"I bought the JBL flip 4 based upon my trust in JBL products and the mostly favorable reviews.  I am an old school big speaker person, but for my new kayaking hobby, I needed something waterproof and compact. I am very pleased, it pumps out a lot of sound, the battery is  more than adequate and it is unaffected by water. It is very simple to connect via Bluetooth.  I bought the teal colored model to match my kayak...Very happy with the JBL flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,We use this all the time. Bought a second one to give as a gift. Great sound output. Easy syncing.Would buy again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful,5,"I bought one of these for my dad a couple of years ago and he LOVES it. Uses it at work all the time. The range is great, battery is excellent, and it still runs perfectly even though it’s been dropped, splashed with water, and surrounded with sawdust, drywall dust, and other particulates. I bought another for a friends graduation gift and he loves it as well. I did order a red speaker, but I received a black. But it’s not a big deal. I’ll be buying one of my own when I have the money"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic speaker,4,I love this speaker- it's a great mix of low cost and great performance.  Sound is crisp and clear.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Portability and great sound,5,Excellent product!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for value,5,"Sounds great, works great for my bathroom which is exactly what I wanted it for. However it is also super portable so will be bringing it with me when I travel. Def recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small but powerful,5,I like it. It's small but the sound is powerful. Perfect size for when I'm on my bicycle.  When I entertain in my yard. Or listen in my kitchen when I cook.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I work in a Diesel Shop,5,"Great speaker. Excellent frequency range and clarity. I work in a diesel shop and I can hear it really good and for me with the speaker at 60%ish volume on a full charge it lasted 7.5 hours which I'm fine with. Really impressed with the battery life to sound quality ratio. Down side is that I never heard a low battery warning. But then again, I work in a noisy shop. I've had it for a week and am very happy with the purchase. It's also cool to watch the subwoofers on the side."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Durable,5,"Have been using it for a year now. I use it every day but the battery is still good, hold up to 2-3 days. Sound quality is good  for in price range. Nothing to complain"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No 12 hour playtime,5,"I take my speaker to work. By the end of my 8 1/2 hour shift speaker is dead. Good sound, but definitely not a 12 shelf life!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super loud and battery lasts a while,5,I bought for a birthday gift.  He loves it! He uses it for work in a very noisy area and is still loud.  He says he doesn't turn it to max volume and is still loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Handy Speakers!,5,Now in as much as i love this speaker sometimes it stops playing and i have to turn it off and pull the wire connecting my source to the speaker. Weird but has happened a couple of times(3). Now i dont know why but hopefully it will not be a norm! Overall satisfied!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent for Audio Books,5,"I very much enjoy audio books while I do daily tasks.  The excellent sound alliws me to hear the books while washing dishes, sewing, etc."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Defies laws of physics,5,"(yet another self-proclaimed) Audiophile here. I've been using this for several months and I'm still in disbelief in the range and quality this tiny equipment outputs. I have several speakers, many larger and some with wooden cases. This can easily hold it's own against speakers more than triple its size and price. It blows my mind how the engineers at JBL achieved this. The bass hits hard and deep and mids are clean and crisp. The gigantic cherry on top is how small and portable it is. I never pack my suitcase without it. Oh yeah, did you read it's waterproof too?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just ok,4,I like this but the volume doesn’t get too loudWhen I turn it up the bass didn’t sound good
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Fantastic Sound from these Small, Portable Speakers",5,"This is my second one of these devices, and they both perform exceptionally well. I have one for my office and one for travel purposes. The sound is rich and clear, and the Bluetooth connectivity is perfect. You’ll be amazed at the quality of sound one can get from these small speakers. They are amazing. Plus, the charge lasts a long time, and charging is easy with the USB plug in."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","We now interrupt your bluetooth speaker use with an annoying blast of unwanted sound, by design.",4,"Sound quality and battery life are good. My only reason for not giving four stars is the annoying chime/musical interlude at a fixed, loud volume that ensues whenever a control function is executed. It's just damn annoying and a design flaw. I know, most bluetooth speakers have something similar - no idea why. How did the designers decide this was a feature and not a bug?If the manufacturers mentioned this, or had a playable MP3 so you could hear before you buy, it would affect sales, I promise."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s great. Love everything about it.,5,Great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Small Bluetooth Speaker,5,"I love the JBL Flip 4 because it provides incredible sound quality in a small, compact package at a far lower price than competing models from companies like Bose. I have one Flip 4 in the corner of my kitchen, and it puts out great, powerful sound. I also love the JBL Connect + feature because it just works and it works well to link multiple speakers together with no issues. Finally, the Flip 4 looks and feels like a far more expensive product compared to the terrific prices it sells for here on Amazon."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great gadget!,5,"JBL  does not disappoint.  Good sound and easy connectivity.  I've used it a lot this summer for all my outdoor projecting.  Paired instantly with my phone and the sound was better than I thought it would be for such a small device.  Yes, I would buy this again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Working great,5,On time and what I orderedVery happy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little Speaker!,5,"I use this all the time. I have other speakers, this ones my favorite. Good size to take anywhere, cord is great for hanging it places and sound quality is great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,I have the four band the five and the four is much better because you can have phone conversations with it.  Not sure why they too that functionally out of the five.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound off,5,These Flip 4 speakers are hard to beat for the price. I have bought one for just about every family member. When we get together it is nice to be able to link all the speakers together. Sound it good. Battery life is outstanding. Had two computers setup with one having a 5 speaker setup and I didn't want to disconnect that and put in on the other computer. I had a bluetooth dongle and used that to connect this speaker to the computer. Problem solved.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound Quality is great!,5,This is a great little Bluetooth speaker.  Great sound quality for minimal cost.  Would recommend this if you don’t want to pay the extra $100 for the Flip 5.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It's Great, buy it.",5,"I really like this speaker, used it for a 10 day camping trip, charging it while on the road in between camping locations. The sound and bass are incredible, perfect place holder for a car with blown out speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Music
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,I love this speaker!! Its perfect for all our adventures! It has great sound and a great battery life. I would definitely recommend this speaker if youre looking for something portable with great sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!,5,"I got this for my uncle, he seems to love it! It has great sound quality and battery life seems daily good. We all spend time outside listening to music, so this has been a great addition and buy. I would recommend to anyone and everyone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Smaller than expected,4,Grand daughter still likes it though
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4 is King!,5,"This is Best in Class speaker, dynamite sound, great battery. JBL-Harman Is king, move over Bose, Beats!!Better sound than Flip 5 too, did side by side comparison."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for the beach,5,"We bought this so we could take it to the beach with us as I it is waterproof,  we are not disappointed with it, great sound and love compact size of it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lots of interference,4,I purchased two of them to use in the backyard around the pool. But they are supposed to connect to each other via their own Bluetooth. But they don’t and even sitting next to each other there is so much static I have to turn one off.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this speaker,5,"This little speaker packs a punch! Sounds amazing, easy to connect and the battery life is great. Sync two or three of these bad boys together and it's a party! Let's go!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great BT speaker,5,"Exactly what I was hoping for! Great sound for its size, battery,  and class. durable encasement.  none of the Quirks in conecting dropping or anything my JB clip had.  this connects to more than one phone makes things like hanging around a campfire or boat that much more fun!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is ok,4,Sound is ok. I wish mine had come with the rubber cover that keeps it from rolling.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound!,5,"We have an older Bose Mini II and enjoy the sound of it, however we wanted a 'cheaper' speaker that could set near the pool or lakeside or on a picnic table at the campground and not worry about being damaged by moisture.  Our speaker has never been submerged or directly splashed with water, but it has been exposed to high humidity, fog, and dew, when left out overnight and it works great and has better than expected sound.  I am truly impressed with the sound for this price point."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,Love the speaker. Used to have the older version until it fell off a shelf and broke. The update is great. Sound is good and the bass quality is good for a compact speaker. The only complaint I have is that the buttons (power on/off etc.) are indented by design and aren’t the easiest to push down but that’s not a huge thing to complain about.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is no good.,4,"I loved this speaker for years. Good sound, always connects, it’s cute.Sadly after 2 years it seems to be dying and batter will not change anymore."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Versatile and handy speaker,5,Bought for my wife for Mother’s Day. She drives a car that doesn’t have Bluetooth. This little speaker provides hours of entertainment from Spotify plus works as hands free for her iPhone. She just loves it…
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy,4,This is a great buy for the many really good and clear sound out of such a small speaker. ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A less expensive option to Charge 3+,4,"If you want better battery life, spend a bit more to get the Charge 3+ also sound quality on my Charge 2+ is better, crisp and good low bass. I've owned the charge 2+ for over 2 years and battery still runs for 8hrs. Bought the Flip 4 a few months and I is less heavy than the charge 2, it doesn't charge my phone, louder than the Charge 2 but distort after you get close to max volume. Battery goes for about 4 to 5 playtime."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Golf speaker,4,Love this speaker. Great sound and clarity. Definitely worth the money. Glad I bought it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ease of operation.,5,Product provides high quality sound reproduction in isolated conditions.  AND performs outstandingly.  Manufacturer states additional JBLbluetooth speakers will pair as multiples providing exceptional surround amplification in synch.Amazing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound....,5,Awesome purchase... crisp and clean sound.  Low notes are amazing from such a small speaker.  It's pretty loud when turned up all the way. Very simple Bluetooth setup..  Glad I bought it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You'll not be disappointed,5,My brother has a Bose blue tooth speaker and has tried to convince me to buy one also. The Bose was twice the price and in my opinion doesn't sound as good as the JBL which has a longer battery life. You are going to like this little jewel.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Power Hungry, great soundm",4,Dies after a few hours even if plugged in the entire time. Great while it lasts.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Sound, Great Value",5,"Portable affordable and great sound quality. I haven’t tested the waterproofness of this speaker (i probably won’t), but I am very happy with this purchase"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect Portable speaker,5,"This thing can put out some sound! The battery life is great and sound is great. Highly recommend.Update: 2 years later and we still love this speaker! Works great, battery life is still going strong, and we have had zero issues with it. Would purchase again if we are ever in need of another one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I was hoping for,5,"We upgraded from a jbl flip 3 because it wouldn’t hold a charge, very happy with the new one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,"I bought it for a gift, my mom totally loved it! The sound quality is great. No problems with Bluetooth connection. Battery life is amazing. I'll buy it again! Recommended"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery low life,2,Gave 2 stars. Sound and connectivity is great but battery lasts only 4 hours if lucky. Would not buy again unless battery life is longer life. Just started using this regularly and battery doesnt last long. Will try find something else that lasts longer. Great sounding product if used only in short time frame
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker !,5,Great speaker ! Have had it for over a year and it stills works great. Great battery life
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound.,5,"I bought this for my husband to mount on our golf cart.. it has great sound, even over the motor and road noise."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud and durable,5,I love this thing.  Sound quality is great. Its loud so easy to hear on a windy day at the beach. Its also super easy to connect to.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",L O V E IT!!,5,I absolutely love it!!! The color is even better in person! The sound is beautiful the base is perfect I have no complaints! Just pay the extra $10 for this color so worth it! (Teal) if you’re buying it for a gift omg they’ll love it! If you’re buying it for yourself YOU DESERVE IT!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overall great sound but bad battery life,4,Use for outdoor work speaker. Bluetooth range great! Sound great. Battery life horrible. Does come with a plug in option.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,4,Not as loud as I would think but great for the lake
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Impressed!,4,"I would expect nothing less from JBL.  Plenty of volume, clear audio, good bluetooth reach and easy connectivity.  Very impressed.  I would definitely buy another one.  I own Bose Soundlink Micro and this thing blows it out of the water on tone and volume especially with the lower bass notes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!,5,"I Needed a new speaker for my bathroom time and was willing to spend just the right amount of money for one. Great quality, sound is VERY LOUD, definitely worth every penny, battery life is great, and it’s portable. I’m very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for all occasions,4,"Great speaker for both indoor and outdoor use. I use it as a speaker for my projector, for music streaming in the apartment, for beach entertainment, and backyard bbqs.I would give it 5 stars, but Ive had some issues with the usb charging port on the speaker. The last speaker I had, the charging port malfunctioned. No bends, not breaks, just stopped charging. Apparently other people had some issues with this as well. Ive learned to be much more careful when plugging in, but is still something I worry about."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great size and sound!,5,"I have one of these speakers.  I use it in my classroom to play music for my students.  I just bought my husband one for his birthday.  He insisted on this speaker not only for its remarkable sound, but for it's size.  His buddy had one and brought it everywhere because it fits in cup holders!  Something to think about :) - car, golf course (cart), boat, PWC, etc!  -and waterproof?!  This speaker is a no brainer.  Get it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING SOUND IN TOTAL PROTECTION.,5,"EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY and PERFORMANCE, GREAT FUNCTIONALITY, COMPACT and LIGHT WEIGHT. OVERALL SUPERIOR PRODUCT A DEFINITE MUST HAVE for any mobile music lover ! Buy the GREAT CASE too for the total experience."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good product for general use,4,"This is a good product for general use. I use it to listen to voice podcasts. Music quality using this product is good, but not great. The one negative is an annoying loud sound when powering the unit on or off. The volume of this annoying loud sound is non-adjustable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",5stars!!!,5,"Great sound! Great battery life! I had o e and lost it, but we bought the same product when we needed a new one!! Love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality product!,4,"It wasn’t as loud as thought that it would be, but definitely does the trick."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",??,5,Highly recommended!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT SOUND,5,I got this for my son-in-law's birthday and he took it to the beach the next weekend.  He was very pleased with the sound quality and everything about it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The richness of the sound is amazingly beautiful,5,Honestly can’t say anything more beneficial about this product other than it makes listening to music so much better and more enjoyable. The quality of this JBL speaker enhances every aspect of whatever kind of music you enjoy listening too. Top shelf. Should be a ten star product. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful little speaker,5,Louder sound then one would think for how small it is! It’s great for outdoors and for inside when the kids need to have a dance party to burn off their energy!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound excellent - and that's the most important thing.,4,"but the design not so great - difficult to operate the on/off switch. And its round shape tends to, you guessed it, roll around.. (at least on my boat and forget about it in your car)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Tinny,4,Not the greatest at high volume.... little tinny while listening to some old school BDP/KRSOne..... not mad.... just a little disappointed..... you will not annoy any of your neighbors with this unless you live in an apartment or condo.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It's A Good Speaker, Just One Problem...",3,"This speaker is pretty good, the audio comes through clearly, it isn't muddied, and the bluetooth connection is fantastic. However, there's just one problem... There's always an annoying crackling/static noise that's extremely loud regardless of volume settings. The noise is very frustrating and makes it hard to listen to music! I almost regret buying this at full price, which is disappointing because of the other positive reviews I read."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL FLIP 4 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker is amazing,5,We had the older version of this and when we got the new version we were pleasantly surprised!  The sound and clarity is a lot better.  Very happy with this purchase.  Works amazing
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,Perfect speaker. Every other speaker claims crystal clear sound or good base is nothing like this one.  I have returned soudcore 1 and Oontz as I was not happy with sound and got JBL that was amazing but to be honest it is triple price of the other first generation speakers that I returned. Overall happy and satisfied with JBL.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good sound,easy connectivity,but the battery life isn’t good",5,I wish the battery life would last longer but for the most part the sound is good and it’s connectivity is easy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great. Indestructible Portable Waterproof,4,Battery runs out and it won't hold a charge when using USB. i have three. love them. No dents or any damage. Can't replace batteries without tearing it up. Will buy another brand that is not as good. Enjoyed it while they lasted. Had them for  years.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No complants,5,Does what it's supposed to do. Great volume. I take it with me even when I go wash my truck and I'm wiping it down.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Firm buttons,4,I dont know how but this one is a hair different than the one I got from the JBL website. The buttons are a little firm and hard to press and it doesnt connect as well in party mode as the one I previously had. But all in all am happy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker but not for long term .,3,I wasn’t expecting my speaker to malfunction after just under two years but it has . Battery life is not accurate and speaker shuts off unexpectedly even when connected to a power source.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little Red!,5,I am really enjoying this speaker. I plan to buy multiple ones in the future so that I can have my music throughout my home and yard via their functionality!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Love it--great sound, great battery life, OK bluetooth range with iPhone. My 2nd one.",5,This speaker cranks out the jams.  Great sound and volume for something so small and I'm always surprised by how long the battery lasts.  This is my second one of these--I keep them at different ends of the house.  My first one has lasted 3+ years and show no signs of age.My friend has a similar size Bose speaker.  It sounds a bit better but costs far more.  The JBL is a great purchase.  Don't hesitate.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"I really like the size, it’s small enough to be easily portable and the sound is great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE THIS SPEAKER,5,"LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!! This speaker sounds amazing and can be used anywhere. It says it is waterproof but I rather not submerge it purposely to find out. Bluetooth is fast and it’s so easy to use. The family has requested this speaker for the last 2 years for the beach. We link up 3 of them and our group of 11 has music all day. The sun, heat and humidity hasn’t affected it. Good volume range too. Can’t say anything negative about this bad boy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,"I love this speaker! I use it by the pool and shower with no issues. It connects blue tooth with no issues.  I can leave the phone in the house and still connect out by the pool. Connection is simple and automatic. I have not attempted to connect multiple speakers yet, but I'm sure it will be perfectly simple.  Battery last for several hours, and since I use it a few hours a day I can get several days use without having to charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Intermittent cut outs,4,"I own two of these and they sound really good. My own fault for not testing the stereo wire feature, they 100% of the time cut out on both speakers tested separately. This is flawed, I do not use Bluetooth and expected this to at least work with a stereo cable.ConsUsing stereo cable cuts the music out on multiple speakers ""Without using Bluetooth""ProsSounds great"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","The quality of sound,battery and charging wis great.",5,I haven't had any accidents to test durability and hesitant on trying it and same with water proof. But long lasting battery and fast charging.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great product, first bluetooth speaker",4,"I love love love this thing! But now I wish I had spent more on a JBL wireless speaker, the charge 3. I wish that the little handle rope/lace thing was longer but I just through a D ring on there and now I can clip it anywhere. Great sound and confusingly good battery life at 3/5s volume. I use it at work for a 8 hr shift and has not died once, blinks red dead, but not died. Charges real quick too. GG JBL!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL builds Bluetooth speakers better,5,"JBL really does Bluetooth speakers right. Great low end, great sound. My friend has a much bigger speaker from some off brand. M to JBL has much better sound and even more volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker with some software issues,4,"The speaker sounds great, has solid lows mids and highs for a speaker of it's size. Two complaints:1. The ""bass radiator"" things on the ends are mostly a gimmick but are a huge trap for sand and dirt. Would have been better with a speaker cap over the ends to keep debris out.2. JBL connect app that you need to connect multiple speakers doesn't currently work on Android P, which is a problem if you don't have an older phone to use."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,"Works great, we own two, gets loud enough for the room and is perfect for a desk. More than a room and you'd need something bigger, but 5 stars still because it's exactly what we wanted."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker besides my jbl charge 4,5,Love this speaker. Clear and loud!!! I work on a tree service and can hear it all the way in my bucket.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",its good just wish it was louder:(,4,It's pretty loud but I expected it to be louder because it's a JBL. either way i love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic battery life and better sound than the market leader,5,"After 6 months of owning this, I'm still impressed. The sound quality and humidity resistance are top notch. I tried the more expensive market leader in sound devices prior to this purchase and the JBL is better sound for a fraction of the price. The battery life continues to amaze me. I use it regularly throughout the week for audiobooks, music, and streaming Netflix, yet have only had to charge it every 4-5 weeks (seriously, whaaaat?!). This was a great investment."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound is crazy ????,5,Love it and I love that I got it on sale ?? for all music ?? ?? lover's a MUST HAVE. Highly recommend boom ?? so much sound in such a little thing wow

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Dynamite!,5,"Dynamite comes in small packages!I did not read the description well and was surprised at how small this speaker is.  Wow does it packages a punch, though!  Great sound!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Second time replacing my original and I still get compliments on it.,5,"Excellent sound quality, long battery life. Highly suggest especially since I’m now buying a second one since mine got stolen. That’s how great it is."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Blueetooth Speaker, JBL nails it everytime",4,"It's a beautiful bluetooth speaker, great bass and amazing sound quality. Definetly the best speaker. The only thing that got me confused is that my package came dirty. I think it was just small dirt particles but no big deal. The product came like new."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just the sound I was look for,5,I love the over sound. It's as if you listening to surround sound. I use it at night while at work to listen to my jazz of Christmas carols and it sound like it the overhead speakers in the shopping mall. Thanks. It was worth it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommend very highly!,5,"This is a really nice little speaker.  It sounds good with rich bass, is super easy to use the battery lasts a long time.  It even looks good."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best sound quality for any Bluetooth speaker in this price range I’ve heard,5,This has the best sound quality I’ve heard in a Bluetooth speaker. Better than my car stereo or inexpensive speakers. Worth the little extra. It fills my room with sound to escape to. Highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Qué tiene buen sonido y se conecta rápido al Bluetooth,4,Tiene buen sonido
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High quality speaker,5,"After trying google home, amazon echo and  bose soundlink II, finally I found the perfect speaker that sounds great and normal easily connects to Bluetooth and has auxiliary connection as well. Have not tested the battery yet since I do not have to take it anywhere and have it always plugged in. Do not know how long the speaker last sine I just got it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING PRODUCT SUPER IN LOVE ????,5,"The media could not be loaded.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",went missing,4,"wondering if price is still the same or decreased at all, thinking about getting another one since mine went missing"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker of its size,5,"Had the flip 3 before this, and the flip 4 is slightly larger but also puts down slightly more power as well. Use this thing every day at work and battery lasts multiple days in a row before charging. I prefer quality over loudness/outright bass and this definitely has good clarity and punch. Gets a bit dry and crunchy sounding as the volume goes up past a certain point. Am a huge fan of JBL speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Great speaker. Could be a little louder. But for the price and the quality of the speaker, plus being able to pair to another jbl speaker is worth it"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,It was exactly what I was looking for! Loud for the size and its easy to transport. Sturdy speaker as well. Would recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker....,4,Great speaker! Would have given 4.5 stars for sound quality but only allowed 4 or 5 stars. Connects easily and easy to pack and carry. Be careful of packing due to exposed side speakers so we use the box it was packaged in to transport when packing out for long trips. Hope this helps! Def recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jbl flip 4,4,Sound good and very good bass ?? and long lasting battrey life
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,4,"the size of the speaker and the quality of the sound, makes for a portable concert hall!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic quality speaker,5,"The JBL Flip4 is an amazing bluetooth portable stereo speaker. The sound is remarkable, really nice depth and base, super clear tunes.Easy to ""pair"" with Samsung phone and tablet.I purchased another cheaper speaker about a year ago, which is good for vocal/seminar listening, however, if you love music, this is it !!! spend the extra ($40) bucks, you will be so glad you did. Great quality, I'm positive this will last for years, and the volume goes up pretty loud, without distortion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,4,"I really love this speaker, connecting it to my phone is never a problem. But, when I try to connect it to a friend's device, when my bluetooth is off, it usually still doesnt work. I have tried searching and pairing, but to no avail.We loved using it at the pool and on hikes though."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small cost for the sound you get. Very happy with it!,5,I spent quite a bit of time researching different Bluetooth speakers before settling on the the one I wanted. The best & most thorough reviews I've seen are by JimsReviewRoom on YouTube. The guy knows his stuff and it's apparent that he spends countless hours going over each and every detail of the products he reviews and what they're best suited for. I watched every Bluetooth speaker review he has so I was in doubt when I chose the Flip4 and I love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get this speaker,5,"I have used a Bose speaker for years, the battery won't hold a charge anymore. This speaker is amazing and an awesome deal. Really easy to connect. Long battery life."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",AWSOME SPEAKER!!!,5,"I bought this speaker to put in my car because i have an old car and the car speakers suck. I am very impressed with these speakers, i have had them for almost a year now and for about 90% of the time they stay in my car in the heat and it is still going great. I have had friends get in the car and complement my speakers because they were so loud. Definitely worth thee price in my opinion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good,5,We have a Bose that could not keep a charge. Bought this on a recommendation from a friend. Sounds really good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great price for great speaker,5,"Paid a really good price for this speaker, it has great sound and bass for its size.  The battery didn't last as long as advertised but it did last for hours."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great compact speaker,5,"This is a great little speaker. I have been super impressed with the battery life and sound quality since it is so small. It is pretty “rough and tough” and has held up being on the boat, on bikes, and tossed in hiking bags. The only downfall is that the connection can be weak in our brick home from room to room, but it easily connects to our turntable and other electronics."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use and great sound quality,5,"My husband could not be more pleased with his gift! We are not electronically gift, but the speaker was easy to work, and I didn't even have to read the instructions!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Gifted it for my dad for Father’s Day. I was surprised by how loud a sound it gives off from a small-ish device. He really enjoyed it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for reasonable price:),4,"Great little speaker. Sounds really good and can be pretty loud if you want. Only con is that the battery doesn’t seem to last that long, maybe a couple hours, but it works while plugged in so not that big of a deal."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",??,4,This is for me.It's easy to use and sounds good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound,5,"I love these speakers.  They are extremely loud, even at 40% volume.  Using one is great but tethering more is fantastic.  The pairing can be a bit spotty sometimes yet this does not detract from the overall ratting they deserve.  This purchase was well worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!,5,Great little speaker. Everyone on the trails wants to get one. Loud and safer then using headphones because you can hear vehicle traffic etc.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker!,5,Quality is good and loved the color.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound! Lots of volume!,5,Holds a charge for a long time. Surprisingly rich sound. Blue tooth was simple to link. Signal reach is very good. Very glad I purchased it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,5,Bought this for my husband to use on the patio while BBQing. The sound is awesome ??  I highly recommend this product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bumps,4,This is a powerful lil guy! Sound and volume are great! Good value for the money!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It randomly stopped working,3,"This speaker worked amazing in the beginning. It was used for my classroom. It was loud, connected to my Bluetooth instantly. There were absolutely no complaints from me at all. Until 3 months later, it stopped working randomly. I mean literally, one day it was doing its thang and the next day when I went to go use it, it didn’t work. I immediately came to the review section of the speaker to see if I’m just going crazy. And apparently this happened to so many people where it just stopped working with no apparent reason. So 5/5 for the first couple months. Definitely a 0/5 because it won’t last long"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,This speaker works well. The sound quality is good! The price was right! The only thing I don't like is that I have to charge it more often.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it,4,Great value for the money. My husband has 2 hearing aids and needed a little more amplification and this was wonderful.  Only complaint was that it did not come with instructions so setting it up was a trial and error exercise.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,4,This speaker has great sound. Perfect for out on the deck!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Sound from Small Speaker,5,Was surprised how loud this speaker was at max volume. The bass too was impressive for this small speaker. Fits perfect in a cup holder.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend,5,"Great product. I like that you can change the light temperature from yellowish to white and that it has a remote, everything is great about this product. Will buy again"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This baby cranks!,5,I love the way this speaker sounds! I've been playing a lot of hard Rock/metal and it sounds great! Highly recommended!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buena bocina a buen precio,4,"Tengo un mes con la bocina y me ha funcionado muy bien, los sonidos se escuchan muy bien, mientras más subes el volumen baja el bass pero no sé distorsiona la música. En cuestión de la batería me ha durado hasta 6 horas diarias. Muy buen producto de buena calidad y a buen precio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,I love this speaker. Great sound for such a small speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",speaker sound quality,5,great sound quality; would buy again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Awesome,5,"great sound, happy with the battery life. Links up to other JBL speakers, even the boom box! Connectivity range with other speakers is about 20-30 feet then it starts skipping out."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this dynamic little speaker!,5,"Could not be more pleased with my purchase. Makes outdoor parties fun, motivates me when I need to clean house, and the sound travels great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",speaker,5,i love this speaker .. i bougth one for my son a few years back and got this for his father for his bday and father day gift
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker on the market!,5,"This speaker is the best! It links to the Bluetooth device super quick and easy, waterproof, really durable and very high quality sound. The sound is by far the best quality I've seen from any portable speaker, another cool feature is they will link to other Flips so if you have a friend with one or you buy another one it will all link together and play! It's a no brainer if you're on the fence, I spent weeks researching and I'm glad i decided on this speaker. Hope this helps, Cheers"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound!!!!!!,5,"Love the speaker.As a long time audiophile I can appreciate good sound quality, battery lasts relatively normal for its size, hangs off my backpack as I walk to work,great speaker!!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud,5,Great speaker for personal use! Perfect base and isn’t too loud but loud enough to cover the proximity of where you need!! Battery last forever
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,4,"Nice sound,  just wish it had usb connect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Ok, Not Great",3,I bought this for my wife because she works overnight as a baker. She plays the volume loud because the building is big. On high volume the speaker died in 3 hrs! She did notice that by playing the speaker on a lower volume the playback time was closer to the predicted 12hrs. Also it would not play while plugged into the charger. Also my speaker was shipped with a scratch on the “JBL” logo plate. That’s minor but still annoying when you buy something brand new.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The JBL FLIP 4 speaker is excellent but it did not come with any charging cables nor instructions.,4,The JBL FLIP 4 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth speaker itself is excellent but it did not come with any charging cables nor any instructions.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, small size, and easy to use!",5,"I love JBL, I have their Xtreme speaker for when I'm working.  I needed a speaker for going to the beach and other occasions, when I don't need the ear shattering sound of the Xtreme, and boy did the flip deliver.  It's way louder than I thought it would be and the small size and wrist cord allow you to hang it from things keeping it out of the way if necessary.  Would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a really nice but small speaker for the beach and camping...etc"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sounding Portable Speaker,5,"I Looked I to Purchasing My Own JBL Flip 4 After My Landlord Got Tired Of Me Borrowing Hers, LOL.  She Got Hers Through Verizon Wireless Almost 2yrs Ago For Almost $160!!!  I Told Her That They Are On Amazon For Way Less Than That...Anyways, I Don't Use Mine Via Bluetooth, I Always Use An AUX Cable When It's Hooked Up To My ZTE Blade V8 Pro Or To My Dell and Acer Laptops.  Watching YouTube Videos and Movies Comes Through Loud & Clear With The JBL!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great size…but I’ve only had it a few weeks and the speaker sounds blown,4,Sound quality not the best
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sounds & build quality!,5,"This thing is AMAZING! Seriously, one of my favorite tech purchases to date. It’s ultra portable, a full charge will last however long you need it to and it is....LOUD! I mean loud!The sounds quality doesn’t suffer when it’s turned up. No rattles, no distortion, just amazing sound quality. Build quality is excellent as well.BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good sound, good looking speaker",4,This is perfect for the home or by the pool... Even a barbecue. Sound is good and the battery lasts pretty long. My only gripe is that it turns off pretty fast after you disconnect and you have to power it on manually in order to reconnect. Not a huge deal but I wish it had a stand by feature so that you could just connect to it whenever you felt like it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Made my 4th Of July complete,5,I used this July 4th at a community fireworks party. This fireworks display in the past was set to music through large  stadium speakers. Last year that stopped.  I brought the JBL 4 speaker today programmed through my phone.  The whole street thought the music was from the stadium speakers but it was my JBL.  Great sound with perfect balance of highs and lows. This made experience with the fireworks that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend this speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,My husband purchased for his job and he loves it. Great sound from a small speaker. Need to purchase the cover separately but it’s worth it to protect it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof AF,5,"During a Kayaking trip with some friends i tied this off to the bow lashings so i could paddle and listen to music. until i flipped the kayak and all my gear was submerged for at least 10 minutes. and when i finally righted the boat, the speaker was STILL PLAYING. I'm blown away at how wel the design prevents water damage, the sound quality is just what you'd expect if not more. just use the charger it comes with, or the microUSB's from Amazon Basics, and you'll enjoy this product for years."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I wanted.,5,"A little short on wifi distance, bit has a great sound and that's why I wanted it in the first place."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great work partner,5,This bluetooth speaker is exactly what I needed to accompany my me while I work. Sound quality is outstanding and it plays all day. Great addition to my tool box
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A must BUY!,5,You will NOT be disappointed!!! The sounds that this little speaker has is great!  Love the fact that it’s so portable! A must have!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom boom baby,5,Love it. I don’t have a stereo in my car- but no ones gonna know with the amount of sound this little thing gives you ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound,5,My teen son loves listening to music on this speaker. When  he lost it we had to purchase another.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for it's price,5,"I'm a huge music enthusiast, kind of a nerd in terms of sound quality and mastering of tracks and proper mixing of treble and bass, and this speaker's price is perfect for the quality you get in return, very reliable"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great surprise,5,This speaker is so good!  The bass is great and the sound is clear as can be!  I was so happy and surprised.  Definitely recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good addition to the outside movie,5,Bought this for an addition to an outside movie experience and it worked out great. Compatible with the projector and everyone could hear it fine.very pleased
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"I got this after having a isound glow tower. The isound was very good for the $50 price, I wanted something louder and with longer battery life. The flip 4 is great, has good bass sound and lasts for hours! I have used it for 4 hrs straight on 3/4 volume and its still playing on lower volume in the house a hr or 2 a day 3 days later! I love that it will pair with another flip4, saving up for another one! Great speaker for just under $100."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny,5,Great Sound. Great base. I'm extremely picky about sound because my best friend is a fanous club D.J. and I've gotten used to being around the best sound. He recommended this so I bought it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the biy,4,This thing is amazing. Great sound quantity. We jad a fire and jammed half the night
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,"I have had a JBL FLIP 4 for about 3 years now and is still going strong, I decided to buy myself another JBL FLIP 4 because of the sound quality and is a decent price for the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,Very good sound...some of the reveiws I saw said that after a bit of time the battery life decreased...so we will wait to see if this happens. other wise great buy  ! highly recommend .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Finite Life - but fun while it lasted,3,I have 2.  Both now about 3 yrs old.  One started crackling recently.  The other one’s battery won’t hold more than about an hours charge.While working well they did stereo beautifully with the JBL apHave replaced w flip 5s.  Note 4s and 5s don’t work together as the JBL pairing mode has evolved
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and long battery life,5,I had this bad boy fully charged before I went on a roadtrip. It was put off to the side and nearly forgotten about. When I pulled it out to use weeks later it still had battery life. I was amazed. Having the great sound quality makes music and movies that much better.No complaints on this product. I’d buy it again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",2nd JBL 4 Purchase!,5,Loved the 1st JBL 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker we purchased 2 years ago that I had to buy another when it was on sale. We can easily pair both speakers and get a bit of a surround sound feeling when using outside on the back deck. Have never had any issues with our JBP 4 products. Would highly recommend. Love JBL
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quiero cambiarlo,5,No se oye muy bien me lo puedes cambiar por favor y no dura mucho y supuestamente tiene full solo dura 2 horas de bateria llena
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for my lifestyle,4,I actually bought 2 and I love them so much I'm gonna purchase 1 more
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Please increase the life of the battery,3,"I bought this solely for work, I work in a 150,000 sq foot warehouse and my area consists of about 1/4th of that. I have it on full blast and the quality is great..I wish it was a little louder due to forklifts always around my desk & the battery last longer but it does its job.Cons:(tested this theory out for a couple weeks before writing the review) I charged it the night before then i would turn it on at 8am and turn it up to maximum and it will die between 10-1130am, even though it states at least 12 hour hold (I also charged it before first use)-if you don’t use the cord it comes with it you can’t even use it on a low without it dying within 20minutes.—even if you use the cord it comes with it will still die just let it charge without it being on.- I can’t hear anyone on it if a call comes in."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Expected a solid product but was greatly dissapointed,1,"I will be writing this view with a total and complete comparison to a $25 Anker speaker I previously purchased.  The JBL beats the Anker in the most important category.  It does sound better.  However, with a much steeper price tag, it better.The Anker is far superior in the other two categories.  I beat the hell out of my Anker and even got it soaked in water only for it to keep on ticking.  Supremely impressed.  The JBL already has a tear in the mesh speaker portion.  It has not been quite as road tested but I'm not very optimistic.The Anker battery life is like a million times better than the JBL.  This is the JBL biggest bust.  I buy bluetooth speakers for convenience of use where power source is limited.  The JBL battery lasts like 2 hours maybe.***This is the most horrendous problem with this JBL***When battery life is complete drained, you cannot listen to music while charging without the speaker turning off.  Did you get that?  You have to wait for the speaker to charge up enough before you can listen even if charging straight into a wall outlet.  The speaker turns off with a power source plugged in???  In my opinion, this is unacceptable.I really wanted to like this product but I don't.  Unfortunately, spending more time to send it back with whatever cost is not worth my time.  Instead, you get this review.  Would spend a little extra money to buy a better sounding Anker.  Sorry JBL.Thanks for listening."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very much worth it,5,The sound quality is what got me loving it. Also the string that attaches to it comes in handy for when i wanna go for a walk. Also knowing that it’s a water proof speaker is cool too so i go outside with it even if it’s raining. I would say that the only thing that might need work is the battery life but that could be just me lacking to charge it. Overall very satisfied. Would buy it as a gift.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I was looking for!!,5,"It has an awesome sound, just what I had been looking for and has a long lasting battery which lets me hear my music throughout the day without worrying to charge it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I like them but...,4,There is way too much base and I wish I could adjust them.  I use them mostly to listen to my audiobooks but somethings it's hard to understand what they're saying because of the tone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker long battery life,5,Excellent product. Great sound and bass. Fast pairing to my device when I turn it on. Able to skip songs by double pressing the play button. Battery life is amazing. I just got it and charged to full. I then played it so that the battery will drain to zero. So far its been playing for 20 hours straight!  Granted I had the volume on soft but its lasting forever. I also have the flip 2. This is bigger and the sound is fuller. Like the idea of connecting 100 flip 4 or synching 2 to make stereo dpeakers. For the price its a steal.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good please buy,5,Good you won't regret buying it
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Excellent speaker, used for backpacking trip and to take ...",4,"Excellent speaker, used for backpacking trip and to take to the beach. Easily hooks up to Bluetooth or via cord. I have heard from others that it easily connects (via Bluetooth) to any of the same speakers, making a whole network of them. The only reason it's missing a star is because it doesn't go quite as loud as I would like. It's great for a small group or for background noise, but you would definitely need more than one for a large group or large area."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker!!,5,I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband. He's a truck driver and he always complains that he can't listen to the music on his phone because his work truck doesn't have an aux port and his cigarette lighter is broken. So I purchased this for him. It has great sound quality and he can hear it clearly over the sound of his engine. It's an all around great product!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this thing you will love it!,5,"I read lots of reviews and was a bit worried. Not anymore I love to listen to jazz music in the evening on my patio and this speak allows great quality sound. I have also put it through a few paces it survived hiking it the desert when it was 100 plus degrees so that I had a little music to watch the sun go down. Great buy maybe not meant to be blasted with a ton of bass but classical, jazz rock and country all seem clear and crisp!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Company great to work with,5,Awesome speaker but save the box and paperwork because 2 weeks short of the warranty expired it stopped taking a charge...but I contacted them right away and I’m getting a brand new one upgraded because the don’t make these anymore.  According to tracking information I should be getting my new one.  But had to return the old one.  But if you need to fix it after the warranty expired go to U-Tube for directions to fix it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,"Amazing speaker. The previous lasted about 3 years before the battery was down to 1.5 hr time of use, whereby I bought this again, and now lasts ""forever"" before I need to charge it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Download an equilizer.,4,"Sounds could be better.  I Downloaded an equilizer, sounds better."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice speaker,5,I've had many jbl speakers and they all work great. this has just the right amount of sound I need from a speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Seems good for the price,4,Good connectivity and sound. Battery life okay havent timed it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Love, love it!!! ??",5,"Awesome speaker works for12 hours best sound I use it at the beach,  picnic or in motorcycle!! Gave one as a birthday gift! We both love them!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound!,5,"Easy set up,  nice size. Excellent sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",BEST BEACH SPEAKER,5,So easy to connect to and use ! We took it on the beach in Florida and it sounded so good !!! So happy with my purchase !! Charges quickly and has clear sound .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,5,This speaker sits perfectly in my golf cart and provides great sound. More than enough volume when you need to crank it up!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product... as long as you don't care about stereo,2,"I tried out two Flip 3's and was having some frequent drop outs in Stereo mode, but overall they sounded pretty decent. The Flip 4's had fewer reviews and are a bit more $$ but several reviews said they sound even better so I decided to give them a try. They definitely sound better to my ears, a bit brighter and warmer at the same time. However, as one online reviewer pointed out, the Flip 4 constantly FORGETS it is in Stereo mode. This is amazingly annoying when connecting via your phone as you have to keep going into the app, waiting for the speakers to be recognized, then setting them to Stereo. But on top of this, it is then IMPOSSIBLE to pair them in Stereo to a Mac, or other BT source because the JBL Connect app is only available on your phone. Wha??? While I do plan to use them occasionally from my iPhone when I travel, I mostly use my mac to stream my tunes and this is completely unacceptable. With the Flip 3, once you put them into Stereo mode via the app, they stay in stereo mode the next time they are paired, even if you pair them to another device. While I am sure others may not care, I think Stereo is adds way more depth to the sound field than having a bit more brightness and warmth in the individual speakers. So unless JBL fixes this in a firmware update, I'd say Connect+ = Connect MINUS. Such a disappointment. I really wanted to keep these, but this annoying flaw kills the experience."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loveeee,5,"Love it!! Wish there was a button to switch over to the next bluetooth device. My husband and I have both of our phones connected and we have to ""forget device"" in order to switch over. Battery life is great too. We had a bbq for over 4 hours and there was no loss of sound or had any issue. I think our phone ran out of battery first. Overall, the sound quality is superb and worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A speaker that blasts as much as I like!,5,Spend the extra money and buy this speaker! I promise you will not be disappointed! So thankful I finally got one that met my expectations!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blue tooth connection,3,"This is my second JBL speaker, I bought a second a one cause ours wasn’t connecting so we thought time for a new one.  I’ve had this one since October and about a month it started taking me several attempts to connect.  It says it’s connected, I can stop the music but no sound from speaker.  Sometimes I’ll get lucky and get sound but then next day it won’t play.  This wasn’t a cheapy so disappointed"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than Google Home Mini in Sound,4,"I always wanted speakers for better sound and volume for parties. I went for this one because it is louder and wireless as compared to Google Home mini. Also a much better base as compared to google home mini. I was for some reason experiencing audio delay in google home mini and i don't in these speakers maybe because of bluetooth versions. Honestly I love the product, giving it 4 because I wish these were little bit cheaper."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great outdoor/indoor speaker,4,"This speaker  is great! I wanted something I could have in the house or take with me to the beach and it is compact enough to do both without sacrificing sound quality. I connect it to my phone and stream music all the time. My only complaint is the battery life, which is still a solid twelve hours of listening at full charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's a great product actually waterproof ????,5,"I use this speaker for everything where ever I go and it bangs must buy, for its size it is pretty loud"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Great!,5,I use this speaker while riding my bike. It connects easily to my phone ans I can control the volume using its buttons or my phone. It sounds great and fits in my cup-holder. Love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Apparently I bought used,4,"This is a great speaker, a lot louder than expected. But for that price I thought it would be brand new. But it came used. No where in the description did they specify that it would not be brand new either. I was pretty disappointed in that. I would have expected a lower price for a used product. That is my only complaint though."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL,5,I got my boyfriend this speaker for his birthday. At first we were worried about how loud it would be with it’s size. But it’s absolutely perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing product,5,"A very good bluetooth speaker, amazing sound quality and well built. Easy setup and bluetooth connectivity. Great battery life. A bit expensive."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sounding Speaker,5,"Hubby loved his speakers.  For the cost of them they are great sounding and are waterproof so can take to beach or out in boat and not worry about messing them up.  The camo color added something extra, he loved it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to charge and use,5,I was replacing my original one. I had tryed the flip5 just didn't like it and didn't need that much capability. Send back and went back to the dlip 4
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It goes boom boom real well,5,"Love this speaker! It's loud and has bass!! Isn't that what we all actually want from a speaker so we cant fully appreciate the rest of the instruments in the song? Loud enough to drown out my sorrows and keep my angry neighbors awake all night! No but for real though this speaker is fantastic and I cant wait for the opportunity to sync it with another speaker to be even more loud an obnoxious. 5 stars, would buy again but I hope I dont have to cause this s#*! expensive."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for bike rides.,5,"This is a great little speaker.  It really pumps out the tunes. I bought it primarily to use on my bike, but have used it in the house, on our boat, and on our kayak. Highly recommend, especially if you bike in groups. You can all get a Flip 4 and sync then up."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bad battery life,4,The speaker is amazing ! Battery life isn’t that great though
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This Battery LASTS,5,"Great speaker, the sound is so clear and incredibly loud for a little speaker. Everyone is always suprised when this little thing shows up with the best sound"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Top notch,5,"If you’re looking for a rather cheap speaker, get this. Not a bad price for the quality. Sounds great, gets loud, good bass. JBL is a quality name brand and this speaker is nothing less than great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best blue tooth speakers around.,5,It's JBL so you know it's quality.  The sound is full and crisp.  Connectivity is a snap.  They really are amazing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for the price,4,"Good sound quality, compact, good deal for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is pretty good and pretty loud,5,"I'm really excited about this!  It sounds really good, although I almost think my 90's computer speakers might still sound better.  This is totally worth it for the bluetooth though.  I'm interested in seeing what the larger model sounds like.  I still can't decide if I like the sea-foam green color.  One thing I wasn't expecting was that it doesn't put out sound in 360 degrees.  It's definitely loudest in the direction of the logo.  I definitely think the money was worth it though!!  I love it so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,Gave as a Christmas gift.....recipients LOVED!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buen producto,5,"Tal vez es más pequeño de lo que se ve en la imagen pero es un gran producto, la batería dura bastante  y carga rápido"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good.,5,"While it is twice as expensive as my other Bluetooth speakers, it sounds much better and it plays much louder as well.Much better than the various Ootnz or Anker speakers I previously used.I am thinking about buying a second one to run in stereo, just for fun...Recommended!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works great and has great sound we love it.,4,I like the color and the quality of the product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Everyone Should Own One of These,5,"Oh my goodness. Everyone needs one of these now. The battery life is amazing and the speaker quality is out of this world. We spend a lot of time outdoors, and the sound is still perfect. The bass is popping and makes this worth the money. I’ve wanted one of these for a while and finally went for it. I so glad that I did!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good speaker, with an audio jack",5,"Sounds great, over Bluetooth.  And I use it connected to my laptop.  Bought this one because it actually has an audio jack!  Imagine that!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality not cheap,5,"It is a very good speaker I have’d used it 2 time for a long period of time, and it still does not need to be charged. And it has great quality sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very limited lifespan,2,"I loved this speaker when I first got it.  The sound was great and the battery seemed to last for days without needing to be charged.  But in less than 2 years the battery life started to drop dramatically and the speaker would often shut off with no warning.  Over the past year I could really only use it for more than 30 minutes if it was plugged into the wall charger.  I finally looked into replacing the battery myself and found some good instructions online.  But when I opened up the unit, I found that the battery was basically glued into place.  It was impossible to remove it.  Obviously JBL makes it extremely difficult to replace the battery in the hope that the consumer will just buy a new one.  Now the speaker is in the trash and I will be buying a new one, but it won't be a JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker value available,5,"Great sound from JBL portable relatively small speaker! I don't know how they pack the live bass, excellent mid-range and high register sound into such a small portable speaker, but JBL does in this Flip4. This is the 3d one I've purchased for myself, my son and now my brother. At $99 it was a good value. At $75 it was an outstanding sound value. Buy it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A good all-rounder,5,"Mainly use it outside, when I'm fishing and grilling, and it works and sounds great. Only had to charge it a few times since I opened the thing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,4,My only issue is the sound controls. The down volume button didn't work at delivery but since I can control it with my phone I didn't bother returning
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,4,"Love the color, size & sound. Wish the bass was a little fuller but the sound is still great for the size & price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth range could be better,4,"Distance blue tooth range isn't great, but acceptable.  You have to stay fairly close to the speaker with your devise.Sound is really good tho."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would buy again to link more though,4,I use it for work with the volume all the way up i get less than 4hrs. Thats the only reason im giving it 3 stars wish the battery life was a little better.Sound: I work in a loud environment so its more of a personal speaker for a small area that im working at the moment other wise its not the loudest speaker because it has more bass than Wounder boom speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound for the size,5,I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by the deep rich tones or crisp highs. Frankly it doesn’t have much range but for the price and it’s purpose it’s one of the better sounding portable speakers. I like that with the app you can setup multiple flip 4’s. Battery gets a solid 8-10 hours at mid to low volume. I haven’t had the chance to crank it for extended periods of time but it’s teally not that kind of speaker anyway. Overall it’s a great speaker and I will use it often especially while traveling.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent for the price,4,The battery tends to be kind of funky. It takes forever to charge...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What a great speaker!,5,"What a great speaker. I was just about to purchase the Flip 3 and luckily noticed this. The bass and treble is amazing. Not to mention, you get a FREE three-month trial of YouTube Red and Google Play Music. Download the JBL Connect app and you can program the triangle button to use your voice assistant (alexa, Google, Cortana, Siri)  or use it as a pause button. I also noticed that you can pair multiple speakers together. You can also access the battery power.Great buy!I'm looking in to buy 2!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,"This thing is pretty loud! The bass is better than expected, also the battery is good but  could be better"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"This is a great speaker. Connects well, battery lasts, and it has a great volume range. It is  really durrable. My son has had his for a couple of years and taken it everywhere. Still works great and looks like new. He liked his so much he ordered this one as a gift for his sister."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,"I love my new Bluetooth speaker already. Nice bass. It instantly connected with no problems. I highly recommend this product it fits in your purse , great for on the run!! Music therapy always. Thank you"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Brings a Lot of Happy!,5,"Have spent the spring and summer with this speaker by my side. On the deck, in the house, by the ocean and on the beach, it has made for many upbeat and happy moments during COVID quarantine.Sound is outstanding. Easy portability. Quick and Easy to charge. Terrific all around."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Batteries suck,4,"Says it has a 12hr battery life.... got 2.5 hours , batteries dead"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Was a bday present but now I'ma have to get one myself ??,5,Damn!! For 80 I get this?! Pretty amazing for the price. Can't go wrong with a JBL! My music junkie homie agrees with me on this too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker all around!,5,We are obsessed! This speaker sounds pretty awesome. Also the linking with other speakers is a great feature. We took this camping and it lasted three days with non stop use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,Had to order a new one as  while attempting to change the battery in another I was unsuccessful in removing two of the screws. Torqued so tighlyt that a ruined two screwdrivers in the attempt.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"This speaker sounds great, very happy with this purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for the beach!!,5,The sound quality is excellent!  Bought it for the beach... fits easily in my beach bag and isn’t too heavy or bulky!  Very happy with the purchase!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not louder than a motorcycle,4,Great for the house. Wasn’t loud enough for the bike
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great audio,5,So easy to use.  Great sound!  We love it for our porch happy hours.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,So easy to use really holds a charge will play for 4-6 hours no problem!Great sound plenty of low range!Would buy again for sure!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Red Lantern of Jams.,5,Dominated our trip to Cancun. Could take it everywhere. Our little red lantern of vibes and music. Great sound. Impressive battery life. Hotel room dance party ready.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good stuff,5,I recommend this model for my needs.  If you want more power and don't mind a larger unit then step up a level.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Had It For One Year,5,"Good quality speaker that last a good while. Currently use it whenever I go out or at work. I work most days so this speaker has had daily use for a good minute, still works just as good and functions just as it did day one. Recommended."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Squad up!,5,"great price, good bass yet still crisp, nice and rugged , outdoorsy , cool looking camo layout etc, I love it. would recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just fine,4,It sounds very loud and it is easy to connect device with other devices. Definitely a buy if you need a speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Money well spent.,5,"This little guy is a sound workhorse! Long battery life, easy connectivity, plus water and sand resistant. Great purchase for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Best in Class, awesome base and sound!",5,"This is a awesome product. I heard one at a friend’s house and ordered this one that night.The most amazing part is that it will run 5-6 hours on a charge!  I have had several small speakers but, this one produces great Base quality.Go somewhere and listen to it; you will be sold!!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",the perfect choice,5,its perfect. no complaints. the sound is great and the size of it is convenient and the boxing looks cool. i really recommend this speaker for any occasion.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect travel speaker,4,"Amazing speaker, will not disappoint. I also own a sonos play1, and play3, and I have to say that this speaker is much better quality than both of them for the price. I look forward to getting another one because these little things paired will shake the room. Only complaint is the exposed drivers, making them untouchable and very fragile. At max volume, highs also get a little too high or flat, but I guarantee you won't need to have this playing above 80% volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Everything and more!,5,I bought this for my dad because he would always use mine lol and he loves it! The battery life lasts so long and it sounds great and can get pretty loud for how small it is! Definitely will buy again for a gift or whenever mine decides to die on me!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get it!!!!,5,Best speaker!!! I got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! Can fit into any small bag and the sound quality is great! Totally recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its lightweight design is only matched by the best sound yet,5,"For music lovers on the go, a must have!!!! The latest in the JBL wireless speakers delivers with extraordinary sound. I have owned the previous models but nothing compares to this speaker. Its lightweight design is only matched by the best sound yet. Rush right out and buy one. Better yet, but one for a neighbor. I can assure you, you will love it. Buy the case that is sold separately. It will fit perfectly while preserving the product.At Sunday's Memorial Day BBQ, it was a huge hit. I am in love with this speaker. So much better then the rest."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good but dies fast,4,"love the size, amazing sound but dies fast"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cute Color and Nice sound,5,"I Love the sound quality, i wish it went up higher actually, but I'm nuts so. It's a bit annoying connecting the bluetooth, switching between 3 devices but it connects quickly. The battery life is insanely great, I wonder how long that will last.... It's dope, I like it, I want to see how it does in a steamy bathroom and what not and really test it out but so far so good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!!!!!,5,"Fir the price, JBL ROCKS! Excellent sound quality… have two for my business & one for home…. It’s a good one for sure"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big fan,5,Was a bit frustrated with my old bose mini Bluetooth speaker because of connection problems & battery did not last long. So bought this JBL. Sound is AMAZING. Battery lasts incredibly long  and it always connects immediately & stays connected. I highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent product,4,Excellent product with great sound quality. Could use a bit more volume. Highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker!!  Awesome sound and versatility!!,5,I bought this speaker to replace the wireless altec speaker I left in Spain with a friend.  I must say I am blown away at theSound Of this small speaker.  I have been using it in my shop where I build guitars and it is a perfect companion.  It pairsMuch quicker than my old speaker and I love the versatility with no wires.  Easy to carry from my shop to the deck.  I plan toBuy another soon to carry when I travel internationally.  Great speaker and awesome shipping from Amazon as usual.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Poor battery life,4,Battery life does not last the 12 hours stated in description. On full charge it only lasted a couple hours while listening to music.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Used it for a week at the beach, lasted all day.  Also used it in the backyard many times.  Sound is great.  Easy to connect to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,Love it! the sound and quality is great. But the charging cord doesn't work. I thought the whole speaker was done for.  I purchased a new charging cord and it worked.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We love this speaker!,5,"Hope this goes on sale again, because my entire family fights over using this speaker. It connects without a problem and the sound is amazing!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disconnects,4,The music randomlyStops very often!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound!,5,Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves this and uses it daily. Great sound quality - which is a huge win for her .. maybe not her neighbors in her apartment building!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for small speaker!,4,Bought for the pool. Sounds great. Last for at least 5 hours may last longer never tried. Would definitely buy another one!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound Quality is amazing !,5,Such a great speaker. Has great battery life and super clear sounds. Plus great bass too! Get it and you won’t regret it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"I love this speaker. It has great sound, and the bass sounds so rich. I’ve had this speaker for 5 months and am considering getting another so I can utilize the multi-speaker link and create little sound system for my apartment. That said, just one speaker does a good job providing sound throughout my 750 SF apartment. I also like how portable this speaker is. Just pack the charger and go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Purchase,5,Love the speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend,5,I had one before so I knew what I was buying.I love this thing.I gave my other one away. So I figured I'd buy one in the color I wanted. LOVE this boy bad.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth It !,5,For the price this speaker is unbeatable. It’s an easy set up with consistent soundquality and connectivity! Impressed with JBL on this one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL ROCKS !,5,"I have owned this speaker for ten minutes so I can’t comment on the battery life. I can say that at less than half volume Al Green is happening! I’m not a techie, but for my ear the balance is perfect, Al’s high notes and low notes are clear,  guitar is clear as well as the drums. Turn this speaker up and drown out the party noise!Once my friends hear this speaker my recommendation won’t be needed. It will sell itself."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever!,5,Dropped it in the water for about a minute. Dried it with a towel and working like a charm after 30 seconds
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL knows sound!,5,Sound is clear and beat crisp... Another JBL purchase that has hit the mark...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small and Powerful,5,This Bluetooth speaker is great for entertaining both indoor and outdoors. The sound quality is great and the price is right. Easy Bluetooth connection
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,Works really nicely between all my devices. The Bluetooth has been strong up to a comfortable distance and I'm able to switch easily between my phone and computer. The sound quality is excellent and the overall design quality is great too. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good quality speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound for something so small,5,Very happy with purchase.  Small but very powerful.  Amazing sound.  I was able to sync it with other kind of JBL for added sound.  Amazing!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Dance of happiness to music,5,Bought it so I could hear music on my deck! It also connects to my projectors Bluetooth and sound awesome! Great for my outfit movies.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound.,5,"It's all about the sound, and this puppy delivers. I've have attached it to my mountain bike, talk about riding in style. Couldn't be any happier!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality was quite inferior,2,"I returned the item.  The sound was muddy and thin, with zero depth.  A no-name brand would sound just as good at much lower cost.  Not what I would expect from JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","If I didn't get it on sale,  I’d return it !",3,The price was reasonable and it’s pretty durable .  The sound is good but not at the highest level .  The design of the device could have been thought out a little better and make it more user friendly ..The contro buttons are raised but black and hard to distinguish especially when lighting is poor ..oh and it has an annoying sound when it turns on and connects with Bluetooth
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My favorite speaker I’ve had,5,"Have had it for about a year and a half and we still love it. Whether it’s in the shower, on the beach, or just for entertaining it has amazing sound quality and battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A Few Things to Consider,3,"Would be a great speaker if it had bass. Switching the  unit to low frequency mode is one option, but the quality of the sound isn’t worth it let alone the damage you will do to the speaker itself if playing at high volumes repeatedly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong and readily available once saved to your device. Battery life is one of the best features for those that hate charging constantly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommended,5,"I recently bought a flip 5 and it was stolen from me, so I decided to just go with the flip 4 because it was a bit cheaper and I really liked the color. I am not disappointed with getting the flip 4.  It’s got great sound quality and good battery life. The flip 5 was a bit better sound quality especially with the bass, but the flip 4 works great for me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounds,5,The quality of the sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and range,5,"Bought this for the shower to listen to music while getting ready for work. Pairing the speaker to my phone was extremely easy. Previous speakers I had lacked range. I can actually walk around my house with phone in pocket and still be connected to the speaker. I have used it about a week, only charging once for the initial charge. Battery indicator only has one of the lights missing. Initial battery life is great. Lets hope it stays that way!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It value for my money,4,I like that’s I can put it any where and it’s loud enough
"JBL Flip 4, Black",small with good sound,5,small with good sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice “little” speaker,4,"Lacks Volume! Nice little speaker but if you want to rock the house, this is not the speaker for you. I bought it to put in noisy jeep to listen to music, volume loud enough to hear but not loud enough to overcome wind and engine noise"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High quality product; Sound quality,5,It’s an amazing product... I highly recommend it. The sound quality is at point. The Bluetooth connectivity is really easy and battery life is amazing... last really long... I’m in live with this product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,they have a great customer service and hope that you are happy with your product. It is authentic and they want to make sure that the product you receive is the product they sell and advertise. Thank you
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Amazing!,5,"I live in Florida and I'm around the water a lot paddleboarding, beach, springs..etc, so I wanted something waterproof.  Reviewed tons of speakers and narrowed it down to the JBL Charge 3 and the JBL Flip 4.  Considered the Charge 3 just to have more boom and extra battery life, but ended up going with  the Flip 4 just because its more compact.  Trust me when I say you don't need the Charge 3 unless you want the longer battery life.  This Flip 4 sounds amazing and get way louder than you need it to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cute,5,"I got the teal color and I love it, it stands out and I have recieved compliments about it. I like how portable it is, I have found it useful and comes in handy on trips and adventures such as spring break and cookouts."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Nice, round sound, easy portability",5,"This speaker has a really nice, round sound with good highs/lows/mids. It's easily portable and works well with Bluetooth. Took it on a trip and was a big hit by the pool! Can't speak to long use on battery power as use it mostly plugged in when home. Connects easily to Bluetooth and can plug in a device to play without Bluetooth if you like. All-in-all a great speaker and not too expensive for the great sound!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Liked it so much that we immediately bought another to link up,5,"Pro: Great sound and volume, easily linked to multiple Apple products, very good battery life, getting splashed with pool water shows no effects.Con: plan out how far you want to space them - ours are outdoors around the pool and once in a while the sound stutters a little when synched up together. Not enough to merit dropping the rating, but if you have a big distance or interference between the speakers, you may need to juggle placement.Overall: great product, no issues after a month of use"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Charge Cord,5,"This is a great speaker, but the charger only works part of this time. Something with the connection. Very frustrating…"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom,5,Had received a different speaker as a gift but the quality wasn't good. The quality and sound from this one is way better. Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not worth the money,5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and hes only used it a few times and the battery does not even las an hour . Very disappointed in the product for the price I paid ?
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So Nice I Bought It Twice!,5,What’s not to love! Great sound quality and great battery life!! Incredibly easy to set up and you’re on you’re way. Lost my first one to the lake while testing a new yak but I had to replace it that day with the very same one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We love this little speaker.,5,This speaker is great to bring along for outdoor parties. Also perfect to use while working in the yard or garage.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Super sound ,JBL quality, must hang ??",3,I'd give this JBL speaker 5 stars if the was a way to out it down on a surface.  But there is not. Theres a photo or 2 of it sitting on a surface but it is not clear that there is no part of the product meant to lay on a surface. so its meant to hang or be held on your wrist I suppose. I was bummed I had to send it back  it wasn't affordable way to have z fantastic quality portable compact speaker for under 100. But its has th hat ond weird flaw which might be why its sold for less than 100.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud for it’s size,5,I’ve bought several of these as gifts because of how good they sound and how easy it is to connect
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound & great range!,5,"Great sound!  It was very easy to set up the Bluetooth connection.  I am able to hang this from the shower head and listen to music or audio books and there has not been a single issue.  Best of all - the range is fantastic.  From one end of my house to the other without any break up.  There is signal loss with distance + no line of sight, but I take it to different rooms with-in 30 feet without any problems."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I’m sonido de lujo,5,Suena súper bien es la versión pequeña y suena en toda la casa
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Pretty Good,5,"For a portable speaker, I think it sounds good.  Depends on the song.  Good to work in the yard with.  Battery lasts quite long."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good purchase,4,Only thing is I wish it was a little bit louder.Veey
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely worth every dime,5,Love it already! Great sound! Don’t even need a sound bar anymore bc of the quality of sound! Hard of hearing and this makes it sound like we’re in a movie theatre
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great value, sound and ease of use!",5,"Love this speaker!  I was skeptical that a small speaker would impress with sound but it does.  Easy to use, great big sound, highly portable.  Would definitely buy another if I needed it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid product good buy,5,Great sound for it's size. The battery life is good. No complaints..... solid little speaker for the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker but battery life a bit short,4,Love it. But battery life a bit short
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Purchased for my 15 year old son.  He uses it when he is training and loves it. Highly recommended.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good stuff,5,"Impressed with the speed of delivery. The sound quality, connected by bluetooth to my cell, listening to specific tunage: the range of tones, clarity, i guy what i knew was a quality product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Sound,5,Don't be fooled. This speaker has some great quality sound. Lightweight but yet sturdy. Easy to connect to my cell phone. Can hear music from my office to my master bed-CLEAR!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker for the size,5,"Tiny but mighty with smooth pairing, great sound quality and excellent battery life. This little guy is a keeper. I lug it all over the place."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,The sound is true with base that is deep. I use this speaker on my boat when floating in the lake.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound,5,"Was going to get a UE but read a review on the bass and they recommended the flip 4. Glad I went with it. Havnt blasted it all the way but close and for what it is, it sounds great. Havnt used it long enough to rate battery yet"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip 4,4,"Nice item, sound,bluetooth,connectivity,and battery life is amazing..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker!!,5,This thing rocks! Bought to take to beach; lasted all day outside! The sound quality is pretty good for the price! I’d definitely buy again!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy it....,5,Wonderful product! We use this while driving our John Deere Gator and the sound quality it excellent!!!  Well worth the money...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound,5,"I grew up listening to WDEL on the AM kitchen radio in the 50's. Steel needles on the old 33's. Compared to that, the sound is divine. And easy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good quality speaker,5,"I use this speaker almost every day. I use it to watch videos on my phone, for parties, in my car, etc. It is loud and has a good amount of bass to it which is important to me. Easy to connect devices, comes in a good package along with the cord that doesn't seem flimsy. Love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",?? ?????? who doesn’t enjoy some tunes.,5,"Has a little bass going on, connects easily to your device and we’ve never ran it out of power??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"I'm very pleased with the sound quality from this device, its sturdy feel, easy Bluetooth connectivity and size.  Works great as a speaker phone.  Good volume with low distortion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this!,5,"This is a excellent Bluetooth speaker and I highly recommend it for anyone!!! I use this everywhere at the battery life is great,  it lasts all day."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Push in the speakers so it doesn’t get water damage!!,5,I only got this speaker a few days ago but I bought it because I’ve used it before. Once on vacation and my cousin had one we used to get high and have really lit jam sessions. I love this thing and all the awesome memories it’s brought me!! I
"JBL Flip 4, Black",you should order a pair or more NOW,4,love everything about my flip 4's
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker I have owned and I have owned several.,5,The speaker came quickly and I have been more amazed everytime I use it at the quality of the sound given the size and price.  It is by far my favorite portable now.  The battery life is excellent. A side plus is the all the extra stuff that you can buy ie. cases and carrying straps and other stuff.  I am tempted to buy another one given the current prices and color selection. Can't say enough good about JBL Flip 4.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Speaker!,5,"I ordered this a few days ago, and I have come to fall in love with it! The sound is phenomenal, and the bass is awesome! Sound clarity is so important for speakers, and this one tops all speakers I've had honestly. I also like how my calls can be directed through it. I currently have a JBL Charge speaker, and it still works great. I just wanted an new one to have, and I have found my favorite. I LOVE IT!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome small and inexpensive speaker,5,"It's smaller than I expected but it sounds quite good and gets loud enough for my indoor and outdoor needs.  My kids love doing ""dance parties"" with it (OMG, that baby shark song will never get out of my brain now) and we use it by the pool without issue.  Works well with our 2017 iPad, an iPhone 5S, and my LG G5 Android phone.The JBL apps are horrible, don't install them. You don't need them to use this speaker, avoid them."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good speakers for first time,5,"this was the first speaker I have ever bought and I was in between jbl and bose. The selling point for this is I can do JBL connect with my friends JBL's and the music is insanely loud, despite the fact that the jbl itself is already loud! I would definately recommend. The usb cable started stop working after ~2 months, and it only works if I position it correctly... but then again it's a cable and it can easily be replaced"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,We love it so much we bought another. Won’t disappoint.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A little less than expected,4,"The sound is very good, but the claim of 12hrs of sound is not accurate. I got 5hrs  after being fully charged.  Keep that in mind."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Needs a little more kick,3,"Quality sound for its size.However, the Bose Soundlink Color 2 handles the lower notes much better at low to moderate volume.  I am not sure about very high volume.  I typically do not crank it that much.But the extra battery life and stereo sound of Flip4 does not make up for its bass deficiency.  Thus the minus 2 stars."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, totally worth the price.",5,"I convinced myself to buy a cheaper bluetooth speaker but decided to splurge on the flip 4 and I'm very happy I did.  I know cheap speakers have come a long ways, but this guy sounds excellent for its size, is water resistant and tough.  I've dropped it a bunch, its gotten rained on and it keeps on going.  Good battery life overall and the bass response is surprising for its size.  Overall I think its a great speaker and I'm super happy I invested a little more than I was planning in it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Make sure to press power button so that you can connect Bluetooth device.,5,I like it because you can play any video websites and music apps through more better clear sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Kickarse l'il Speaker!,5,Very happy with this as a portable/remote speaker. Great sound reproduction for what it is!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cool,5,"My friend has a FLIP 3, I was impressed on how well it worked and sounded,  not to be outdone , i got the FLIP 4.  I did spend some time reading reviews and researching on the web.  I am very happy with this speaker. I you have a tv box with Bluetooth it is really nice .  Easy to connect.  Just turn on Bluetooth in settings,  turn it on and this will appear on the list.  Can get pretty loud, good bass I will probably get another someday soon"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good all around speaker.,4,The Bluetooth stays connected at a greater distance than my Bose Soundlink mini 2 did. The sound quality is good but does not have quite the bass as the Bose had but that can be a good thing because the Bose had far too much bass at times. I used the JBL for a few hours outside at almost maximum volume and the battery was still at maximum.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Excellent purchase. I have has this for 2 years and I take it to the lake and I evern forgot it and left it out on the rain. Still works as new. Great purchase..5-26-20.  I dropped it in the lake.  Swam to get it. Found it. Towel dried it. And still works!! Whaaatt.  This is awesome ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker horrible customer service from Amazon.,5,I love the speaker but hate that I was overcharged as it was a deal of the day at.59.95. Amazon has horrible customer service. Guess I will just lose 20 dollars
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,5,Got the speaker for my daughter’s 14th birthday. She loves it! The sound quality is so good it is amazing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must have,4,Great product sounds better than expected
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,4,I will only buy JBL's. Live the sound quality of them. Decent size for whatever your doing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Compact, great sound quality, great battery life.",5,"No complaints with this little gem. Take it with you, rain or shine. Sounds great. Good bass response in such a compact unit.Bluetooth connects with no issues and has decent range. Battery life is really good in my opinion.Try it, you'll like it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little spaker,5,only had this a few months but so far it works great.  I use it outside on patio. It has a pretty good range. I connect it to my cell phone with Pandora and leave the phone inside the house and close the door and it works fine.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,"I have two of these, I like them, they go pretty loud. But I love how easy they are too move around the house"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible,5,"This speaker is amazing 2 years and they are still working like the first day, I wanted to upgrade to Flip 5 but I use the aux cord a lot so I'm not ready for that"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",love it,5,i love this product still works well after months of use and i use it alot
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Seriously?,5,If you have to ask any questions about this then you don't know anything about the brand. If you're going to buy a Bluetooth this is the only one who should get. The price doesn't get any better and neither does equality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,"Awesome sound in a little package. Bought 2 and linked them up, and they work as left and right speakers. My son loves them and wants more!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound,4,Nice sound easy to use
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not happy with this product,2,"The sound quality was good but it doesn't have nearly the 12 hrs of play time it claims to have,the battery started getting shorter and shorter and it won't take the charge now."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a small speaker!,5,Great product from JBL Bought this speaker for its small size to take on our trip to Cancun. It sounds so amazing that I now take it to work to listen to it  One of my coworkers loved it so much he bought one as well! We link them together which works really well by the way and listen to them while we work. The battery life isn't great but lasts probably 5-6 hours with both bluetooth and linked together... We just keep them plugged up and they last all our 12+ hour shift!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It was compact but the sound was awesome very easy to connect to my phone,5,I ordered the speaker for a birthday present it came earlier than l thought l was super excited that l ordered another one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality for its compact size and awesome color options!,5,Amazing compact speaker. The hype is real with this product! Battery lasts super long and the color options are a nice plus. Haven’t taken it out on the water yet but it’s nice to know I don’t have to worry about water damage!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality and volume,4,Fits my waterbottle cage on my bike.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I am very happy with my jbl speaker,4,Sounds awesome ?? and the battery life is very good ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good product,5,"This is our second one.  I really like the clear, crisp sound quality, and amount of volume.  Great product for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't buy a second Flip4 and expect stereo sound!,2,"I bought a second Flip4 to set up one speaker as ""left"" and the second speaker as ""right"" as advertised.Unfortunately, the software essentially doesn't support this. Frustratingly, the software will allow you to switch it to ""stereo,"" but once the app closes (which it will unless you keep tapping it), it defaults back to ""party boost"" mode. So you can't play them in left/right stereo for more than a song or so. The app developers could fix this easily, but they haven't. There is also no app for a PC or Mac, so you can't hook them up in stereo unless it's from your iOS/android phone or tablet (not that you'd want to for one song at a time anyway).So don't buy a second speaker and expect to be able to configure them in left/right stereo. For all practical purposes, this functionality doesn't exist."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Colectividad excelente,4,Se escucha un poco bajo el volumen
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip.,5,I absolutely love this speaker.I work withs bands and choirs and this is really good for sectional work.The battery last longer than I ever expected. I love the water proof feature too.Devices connect very easily to the speakerThis speaker has a really rounded sound. Good bass and Excellent treble.I highly recommend this speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good stereo to carry on everywhere,4,"Liked this stereo, the volume is ok for closed places and little parties, the battery lasts only like 2 hours. It really sucks. Thought it will be a bigger stereo but the size is very comfortable to carry on. And you really need to buy a case for this because it seems really delicate"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is amazing,4,Amazing sound. Wish battery was longer life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,My husband has to have music playing during day time and he loves my gift. Sound quality is great and battery life is long.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Float?,5,Lmao no it was the best speaker I'd ever own till it fell in the lake and sank doesn't float.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Beautiful sound. Easy to use,5,Beautiful sound. Easy to use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Sound is great! Take anywhere. Love love love it! Can listen to music I thought I would never hear again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow!  AMAZING SOUND!,5,I love this speaker!  It's small BUT packs a lot of sound into its small size!  I am so impressed!  I highly recommend it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality hardware,5,The construction is solid and durable and the connectivity is flawless via bluetooth. Great sound quality and loudness is great for the compact drivers in this device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",... speaker and i couldn't decide which brand was the best for me,5,"I heard about this portable bluetooth speaker and i couldn't decide which brand was the best for me, because of the price, the quality, the modelthe colors... and well i decided to try with JBL.. and i fell in love... the first time i tried my new speaker the sound of the music wasawesome!!!!!!! and of course the price is great in comparison to others brands, i choose a delicated color (turquoise ;)) and the model, the form,is comfortable for my hand, i can take my new portable bluetooth speaker everywhere i want to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound quality,5,Gave this as a gift to my husband so he could enjoy his play lists- I admit I enjoy it too! The sound is amazing!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must have for summer,5,I debated between this one and another popular brand which was more expensive. Glad I went with this one. Seamless Bluetooth connection and nice sound and volume!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,5,"The sound is perfect! It connects to any bluetooth very quickly, and no problem with that! Battery life is okay not that bad."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product!,5,I love everything about this speaker.  Was easy to set up.  Always connects right away and has excellent range.  I would recommend this and am thinking of purchasing a second one!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Still going strong!,5,"This speaker has been under heavy use and it’s still like brand new. Good value, quality speaker, and lasts forever."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",DefDefinitely waterproof,5,Amazing!!! I took it to the beach the other day and had it attached to my umbrella. My umbrella blew I to the ocean and was floating for about 20 minutes with the speaker attached. The speaker still works perfectly.  Just make sure the charging port is always covered.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,Excellent add on for my cell. Outside or inside I hear my music and calls.Only thing I would add is a microphone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life and Bluetooth info,4,The speaker works as described but there are some room for improvements. Battery life doesn’t last as long as stated when used at 80% volume it only last half. Also the Bluetooth connection should have better info displayed on my phone like battery life and so on. Even my cheap $10 Bluetooth speaker has this feature.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery no longer holds charge,3,"When this speaker worked, I liked it quite well.  I bought this in 2017 and it worked perfectly for about 18 months.  Then I noticed that the battery life was slowly decreasing.  Eventually it would only run for about 5 minutes after being fully charged.  I contacted JBL customer service and they sent over some trouble-shooting tips, but none of them worked.  Since it was out of the warranty period they offered me a 20% off code for their website to buy a replacement.  However, I am contemplating if I want to buy another JBL and have the battery die in another 18 months again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surprising sound!,5,Tried 2 other speakers and found them wanting especially as regards sound quality.  Bought this 6 months ago and am still surprised at the sound quality and long battery life.  It's not going to handle the needs of a wedding reception but it's plenty powerful enough for a porch full of people.  Remarkable and clear bass even at low levels.  It's just a really good wireless speaker and well worth the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound Great!  But default to party mode instead of stereo???,3,"I purchased 2 of these with the intentions to run them is stereo.  Well I was very disappointed that the default mode to connect 2 or more is mono!  In order to get them to connect in stereo you nave to use the Connect app which is not available for Windows.  Besides the inconvenience with have to use the app, the application only works 50% of the time. and will intermittently switch back to mono when a video is changed in YouTube.  If JBL would release a firmware update to change the default connect mode to be stereo! I will change my rating to 5 stars!  Build, sound and battery life are all excellent!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,4,"Great battery life, easy connection"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So much sound!,5,"This speaker performs like a champ. The Bluetooth pairs up quickly and easily. The sound quality is very good, especially for such a small unit. At night I pair it with my Google Home Nest and drift off to jazz.I am thinking of buying a second one and setting them up in a stereo configuration."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker wit BIG sound,4,"JBL flip4 speaker has great sound quality. If you’re looking for a speaker on the go, it can’t be beat! Set up with two phones was simple and charging it was easy and fast"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,This is an excellent speaker. Great sound when I’m working in the yard or around the house. Easy to connect any device to. I’m very happy with it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressed!,5,"Had my doubts about the power and quality of sound, no more. For a compact speaker it cranks!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You’ll use it more than you think.,5,I love this speaker so much I bought one for my daughter. Very portable and water and weather proof. Perfect for the beach or boat. I take it wherever I go.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!!,4,the speaker tends to die a lot more frequently than i expected it. i haven’t tested out the waterproof ability yet but it has very good sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Very good sounds and quality works great full battery is about 3 to 4 hours life but takes to long to charge but im happy with the price
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good speaker, but mine died for no reason.",4,"This is a great speaker. It sounds great, and it looks pretty sleek. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is quite expensive, and I had one break on me after just a few months of light use. It was good enough that I purchased another one, but I am really concerned that it just broke out of nowhere."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!!,5,"It's everything I wanted and more, the sound is amazing for the size. Love this porduct. Btw I take it on my kayak."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must have!  Love it!,5,"This is such a wonderful portable speaker.  Love the blue tooth functionality, great sound, and nice looking.  Love the ocean blue color.  We’re all enjoying listening to music while outdoors swimming. I’m impressed with the sound quality for such a small speaker. Great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It worth paying $$$ great quality on sound,5,JBL is the best one out ther battery  like is great and the the sound is great we took ours to the Beach and ppl where able to hear our JBL and then bluetooth with the other JBL we had grat party.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible sound quality,5,The sound from this speaker is incredible.Its really a cool addition to my desk at work.The vibe on my desk is totally different now.Love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker I've ever purchased yet.,5,I was surprisingly amazed by this jbl speaker. The sound quality is premium and powerful. It's like i'm listening a music to a sound bar with a subwoofer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Durable but Lacks bass,3,"Overall this is a good quality speaker.  I was a little disappointed by the bass and it sounded a bit tiny.  But for the size and durability this is a great product.  For something you can take to the pool, throw in a bag to take along, or just use it on the go it's a great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,Jamming out
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Speaker,5,I was very impressed with the quality and range of sound with this product!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Little speaker, big sound",5,"I bought the speaker for my wife and am very happy I did. The sound is robust, crisp, and soulful. It was easy to sync up with her phone and iPad. She is happy so you know I am happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound in a small package.,5,I work at nights in isolated areas and freezing temps. Bumping to my music helps me to keep warm. The sound coming out this thing is crystal clear and you can almost feel the base. Just wish it had a clip or something to help attach it to areas that aren't always flat. Battery last all night (7hs) and it's small enough to throw in a suitcase to take on vacation to enjoy your music wherever you go.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Small Speaker,5,We use this on patio and it does its job wellOn time as described. Will use vendor again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"This JBL bluetooth speaker has really great sound for it's size.  I tried lying it down and standing it up and think the bass is a bit better standing up.  Also, the bluetooth connection range seems to be pretty good as I can move with my phone into another room in my house away from the speaker without any disruption to the sound.  And I would add that for the price it was a pretty good value."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this,5,This was given as a gift and easy to set up and plays for a long time before needing to recharge
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don’t get wet,2,Product is great… if you don’t get it wet… took it floating on the River and it got wet. It now turns on and off randomly and disconnects. Super unhappy with spending so much on a “waterproof” speaker that couldn’t handle a little water.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best wireless speaker I bought for the money,5,Works flawlessly. Battery works even after being left in the car in over 110° weather for An extended period of time
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker is awesome! Best speaker purchase I've made,5,Really well constructed speaker. The Bluetooth is very stable and connects so quickly without any issues or interference. Has great sound quality and the bass is prominent compared to other Bluetooth speakers I've used which just seem to only have treble while still being loud which hurts the ears. Super loud for the size and absolutely water proof. This speaker makes me trust JBL and Harman Kardon products. This is more than what I expected from this product and I am very pleased with it. I'm considering getting a second one just because of how well it functions
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL speaker,5,This is a great speaker with good base and a clear sound It's small enough to bring it everywhere you go but big enough for the sound you need
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, horrible battery life.",3,"Great sound output for the size of the speaker, crisp music. Only extreme downside is the lack of battery power. The box says 12 hours of battery life, but it barely lasts 4 hours on complete full charge. I’ve tested this for several days, and it always just before the full four hours of usage. False advertising at its best. Don’t expect long life unless you’re leaving it on the charger the entire time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Exactly what I wanted,5,This is perfect for my room in my shared apartment. I can use it in my room while I do work or I can move it into the living room when we have friends over- the sound quality is just as good at high or low volume. One of my roommates liked it so much that he got the same one in blue. A high quality speaker for an awesome price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good sound good price,5,"received in one day . turned on and sound and quality are both great . of course this is not a full stereo system  . but for a grab and go speaker running off Bluetooth with the great selection of amazon prime music you can't go wrong with the JBL flip4 sound is very nice , I mounted between the handle bars on my motorcycle turned up volume and it great . very happy with the unit so far"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect indoor and outdoor sound,5,User friendly.  Great sound quality.  I set these speakers for our last outdoor party. They were perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I can't wait for poolside parties!,4,For it to be so small it actually does have a pretty good sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Looks good,  sounds ok",4,Doesn't sound as good as I wanted.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality speaker!,5,"I bought this as a gift for my son. He loves it! The sound quality is fantastic and can be played quite loudly. The battery lasts for quite some time, too."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound great,5,Don’t have no dislike
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Perfect for picnics
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound!,5,I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this for my son.  The sound quality is awesome!  I LOVE the color!  (He wanted red.)  I now plan to order one for myself.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Finally bought one for myself !,5,I’ve bought these for Christmas and birthday presents over the years- finally bought one for myself! Connecting is a little tricky but it could be the WiFi or the user- lol Great sound bought it for the office and to take to the lake!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product.,5,I love this little speaker. It puts out a great sound for what I use it for. The sound travels through entire house nicely. The bluetooth hooks up easily from either my laptop or my phone once linked. Good purchase so far!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best money spent,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Great speaker sound quality is good and portable I got it because I wanted a portable waterproof speaker best money spent"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound bad design and material.,3,This was a great speaker for about a year and then the fabric peels away from the buttons. I recommend just going up to the charge because it’s durable and just over all better quality. This is a good speaker for your car but do not leave it in any heat over a course of 3 months mine started to peel and wearing out.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality,5,I had owned two Bose Bluetooth stereos before and this has way better sound and durability.  The Bose were both $20-30 more expensive.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Awesome speaker, have taken this to the pool and beach",5,"This speaker is great to take to the pool and beach. Easy to pair with my phone, sound is great, compact and durable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",MUST BE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.,1,"Let me first say, this is my second JBL flip 4, the one I had prior to this was an absolute BRUTE. I’m talking tough! It had been submerged under water, dropped countless times, taken to the beach, withstanded super hot summer days for hours, getting caked with mud but alas, it got ran over by a car while off-roading one day... but guess what? It STILL WORKS. Even in its smashed up state nothing broke but the speaker cover protector. So bravo JBL, this is a great product. However I bought this one for my father for his birthday, he only used it a few times in his bedroom and now it won’t turn on at all, so I tinkered with it come to find out it was a remanufactured speaker put back together incorrect without water proof rubber gaskets for the speakers, keep in mind I payed full price for a NEW speaker! Now the return windows are closed and I’m unsure who to contact to hopefully make this right..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We love shopping Amazon,5,I got this speaker to use with my ALEXA and to listen to my music. I like this brand JBL. I’m not real happy with this speaker bc it doesn’t stay charged for very long at a time. That’s all
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I will be ordering more from AMAZON. Prices are great Thank you,5,I got the waterproof JBL for my niece for XMAS last year. She is in MUSIC PARADISE. Everything they said about the JBL it was worth the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","JBL does it again ... quality, durability and value",4,Worth every dollar! Good buy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic product with great tech support to back it up.,5,"Never had any issues with any JBL product. This speaker has great sound quality for its size especially.  Very portable, easy to use. Battery life is fantastic! Very durable— takes a great beating and takes falls. Had the same product before and lasts a long time.  Also tech support to order new cords is fantastic!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just So So!,3,"Nicely packaged. However, the flimsy instruction sheet in a jumble of languages was so insufficient as to be rude, besides being printed in such small type as to require loops! I had to turn elsewhere to understand how to employ bluetooth connectivity. The bass and trebble are merely adequate. This unit replaces an older JBL Flip whose battery began to fail big time. Beware, the larger newer unit doesn't even have sterio!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Won’t be disappointed with quality,5,"Amazing product ... sounds loud but clear at same time! Only little downside is the battery life... I charge it full the night before and it runs out in like 3 hours of use, I thought it was more than that. But I assume it’s because I live in cold Minnesota and I am using this in the car/garage which are both cold"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just get one,5,"Ive had cheaper speakers, and this one isnt even comparable to them, great speaker just get one"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth speaker,5,"Out of all of the speakers I have had,  I like this one.  good sound,  good battery life so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound. Using multiple's a bit clunky.,5,"Great sound. Its a good balance between price and sound quality. Best value!I like this speaker so much I bought a second one.The only complaint I have is when running 2 I can't differentiate between them in the bluetooth selector; they both have the same name. The SW for using them is nice and gives you a picture to differentiate them (assuming you got different colored ones), but it's slow and doesn't help when only wanting to use one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great lil speaker,5,"Love this speaker! It's so cute, very portable, has decent sound and holds a charge for a long time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for poolside!,5,"Got this for our pool! Sound is great, connects easily to my iPhone, and battery last a long time!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is more than enough speaker for just about any situation,5,"Battery life is exceptional, sound quality is exceptional and it is very easy to setup, even for a novice"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Se los recomiendo muy útil,5,"Muy bueno con un sonido envolvente, con una batería muy buena y se conecta al bluetooth bien fácil ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not loud enough,4,Expected it to be much louder. Functions fine.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,Love it.  This has opened up a whole new world of music on-the-go for us!  Sturdy and high quality.  Great sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My favorite speaker,5,I love this speaker. It is so quick to connect and the sound is Crisp and clear.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It doesn’t work,5,So I’ve been using it for 3 months but not that much and its stop working. Out of nowhere the music stop playing on the speaker but keep going on my phone. So its like is muting by itself without me touching anything. And that happens a lot. I use it for like 5 minutes and the problem happens. I have to turn it off too many times so it start working again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Okay speaker,5,"The battery life isn't the greatest with these in my opinion, but the sound quality is outstanding."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Versatile,5,Use this thing for little backyard kick backs and in the shower :) versatile little thing. The bass is pretty awesome and doesn’t overwhelm the highs and mids.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfied with this purchase,5,I do like the convenience of the blue tooth speaker. Can set it outdoors while barbequing and it plays my music adequately; the sound is above average.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it,5,"It’s a lot louder than I was expecting, and it also can connect to my moms JBL speaker on like a party mode... that’s cool"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds great, but fails in other respects",2,"I bought this speaker about a year and nine months ago after returning one of the same model because I thought it was defective. It had terrible Bluetooth connectivity; it was unable to keep a solid connection more than about 20 feet from the source.This one--the replacement--was a little better but still not impressive in that regard. Still, satisfied that it wasn't so much a defective product as a design issue, I decided to live with it. The sound was good, and the battery life seemed pretty good too. I was happy enough with this for a few months. Then the battery life started plummeting.Today, I can't go more than an hour before it needs to be plugged in. I basically use it as a wired speaker now due to the poor battery life. Also, the Bluetooth connectivity continues to be more than a minor annoyance. Two (small) rooms away from my desktop computer and it struggles to maintain a constant connection. Whenever we use wifi connected devices around it, it 'skips' due to apparent interference. If the microwave is on, it skips.My opinion of this speaker wasn't sterling to begin with--although the sound is good--and it has gone down steadily since I bought it. My former roommates had a UE Boom and it seemed to be far less issue-prone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hi Fidelity. But there is a volume ceiling,3,By that I mean rocking out in my small 500sf apt front room carpeted and furnished. It doesn't tip the scales as far as sound volume. I think for the extra 20 bucks for the next size up I should have done.The sound fidelity is very good. Just need that rockers ompf.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL does it right...,5,There's nothing like the sound of a JBL speaker no matter how big or how small it is JBL does it right
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Sound!!,5,"If you care about sound in a small portable speaker...this is the way to go!  It has a dynamic range, deep bass, and a quality design.  I have had JBL speakers before and these do not disappoint!  Buy this speaker...it's worth the price!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good range, excellent sound!",5,"This is the only ""stereo"" I own. It is plenty for my apartment without disturbing my neighbors.  The best part is it's weather proof.  I strap it to my bicycle and am able to enjoy my music, and still hear traffic around me. Deep bass,great mids, and the highs are clear.  Great for rock, country, or anything."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Met my expectations,5,I bought the JBL flip 4 to use in my office and I'm pleased with the sound and quality. It works great outdoors on the back deck also.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality/bass,5,"I absolutely love it. I am usually a beats by dre type of girl, but I got to hand it to JBL this speaker is loud. Sound quality is great. I recommend the jbl flip 4 to anyone. I will be traveling with my speaker for my mini vacations. I like to listen to music while I’m cleaning, cooking, showering, game nights at my house, etc."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,5,Love the color. The sound is perfect for the size of this speaker. This is my second JBL speaker & the improvement is marvelous
"JBL Flip 4, Black","great product, but...",4,"Love the sound, love the waterproof...50/50 on the battery life.  when played at higher volumes battery drastically takes a dive.  but if you choose to have good hearing well into your older ages just don't play it that loud...HAHA.  other then that, great product.  compact, easy to navigate controls and connectivity."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buen regalo aunque le falta un poco de calidad al sonido,5,Es un parlante muy bueno para paseos. Se lo di de regalo a mis papás y les encanto.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super happy with it - Sounds as good as the ...,5,"I have a Bose Soundlink Color bluetooth speaker that my wife decided was hers.  I didn't want to spend over $100 so I purchased the JBL Flip for for my travels for roughly $85.  Super happy with it - Sounds as good as the Bose for around $50 less.  Good Base, nice mid-range, plenty loud enough and appealing design and materials .  Can't go wrong with this, esp. if you're looking for the best bluetooth speaker at under $100.  Pull the trigger and get it!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Previous reviewers are RIGHT! This thing is amazing and less than Bose!,5,Really impressive. I was going to buy my husband a more expensive Bose speaker but the reviews on this made me change my mind. The reviews were right! It’s really great sound quality. Easy to use and connect. Used it in the shower even. There is bass vibrations at both ends that really round out the sound. Trust the reviews. They are all right!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",UGGHHHMAZINGGGGGG!,5,"This speaker completes me! It sounds awesome It works awesome and it holds a charge nicely! i use this pretty much daily and at a bar that sounds amazing through the whole bar! my customers ask about it all the time, is that seriously that little thing playing music? Yup that my baby JBL Flip 4 ~ rumor has it that it can be submerged under water too... i am not doing it to mine but how cool is that?!? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is not good,3,I use this speaker daily and I work 10 hr days. Even on lower volumes this speaker barely or not at all makes it through the day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High Quality Bluetooth Speaker,5,The speaker is great quality. Has a nice bass to it and everything is very clear. Battery lasts a long time too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Oldie but goodie. New isn’t always better.,5,"The best part about a flip-4, is that it doesn’t take any brand new charging use your old AT&T or Apple chargers.??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,Works amazing! Love using it on our boat or out by the hot tub! Great sound quality and easy hook up!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof!,5,"My previous JBL 4 year old speaker was damaged by water. I replaced it with a flip 4, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much the sound quality has improved since my original purchase, and it is waterproof!  I had my old plug-in charger and case that fit the new flip 4 which is helpful. I would’ve been disappointed if I brought a speaker without a protective case and durable wall charge cord; but that’s how they are keeping cost lower."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buena ambientación,5,"De gran calidad, muy buen sonido y de fácil conexión"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL rocking speaker,5,The speaker have very good sound. It connects easily and play effortlessly.  Great item to purchase
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect Small Bluetooth Speaker,5,"We use this trusty Bluetooth speaker all the time!  It’s our second one. We lost the first one when traveling. The sound quality is great, can get pretty loud for a little speaker, and is super portable. Obviously, would purchase more than once!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,"I love how it sounds, I don’t like that i charge it and it’s like it doesn’t charge for more than a few minutes. So the sound quality is great but the battery life just sucks!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sound Good, Battery Life Not Full 12 Hours",3,"While it does connect to a device quickly I didn’t like the fact that the battery doesn’t actually last 12 hours, it doesn’t even last 8hrs. I bought this to take with me to work, but I’m disappointed that it doesn’t last my whole shift even if I charge it till it’s full capacity. The sound is good for its size, you can hear the music clearly and the bass goes well with the speaker. Good enough, but I’ll repeat again (as it was what made me buy this speaker in first place) it doesn’t last even 8hrs before the battery dies."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,5,Works great. The only negative is the connectivity range isn't that great. Good speaker would buy again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent spe,5,"The sound quality that BOOMS from this miniature speakers puts me in a state of awe!  Technology moves so quickly and I've bought ... countless speakers over the past 2 years.  This is definitely one of the best little speakers on the market!I wouldn't use it for a huge party, but it's perfect for a picnic (intimate or family style), workout session motivation, background music while cleaning or entertaining."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",How does all that loud and amazing sound come out of this mini me of a ...,5,"Never write reviews but this speaker is seriously a beast! How does all that loud and amazing sound come out of this mini me of a speaker!? Its 5x louder and 10x clearer than the ""tailgater"" I bought a few years ago, which is the size of an 80's boom box.And the people with the reviews complaining about the turn on, off, and connect noise seriously should stop complaining about 1st World problems. Just stop complaining!Purchasing another for ultra prime sound wherever I go."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery lasted about 1yr,3,"I enjoyed using this speaker for about the first 12 months. I've used it for listening to conference calls, attached to my PC for audio (music and movies), connected to my devices via Bluetooth and streaming music. After about a year of use though, the device has started acting up. The issue appears to be battery related. I can no longer use it at higher volumes. When I do, it will work for about 15-45 seconds before it starts making a crackling sound and then shut off. I can prevent it from happening by lowering the volume. The only way to use it is to run it a lower volumes which is not ideal for outdoor use, my main reason for purchasing it. I might buy a replacement battery for it in hopes to restore its usability, but I'm looking at other Bluetooth speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sound great,durable,but-doesn’t hold a charge very long",4,"Sounds great,durable,but doesn’t hold a charge very long."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent purchase. Fine sound.,5,JBL has the best quality sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good little speaker for the price,4,The only thing I don’t like about this speaker is it’s volume controlled by yr phone but the sound is very good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Makes a great gift!,5,"We have 2 JBL Speakers - great sound, gets loud, battery last forever!  We take them golfing, boating, camping, use when house cleaning or just relaxing outside on the deck.  Can even sync the two of them together.  As for the these particular models - we ended up purchasing the Flip 4 speakers for gifts for our bridal party.  They loved them and thought it was the best gift!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The only speaker you’ll ever buy.,5,Great speaker for price- excellent quality. Have bought before and now just bought one for my nephew as a gift. Sounds quality lasts for years and years.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overall all a great quality speaker!,5,"Coming from the flip 3 Iwasnt expecting anything to be crazy new. There is a complete difference in the build quality and battery life between the two. Flip 4 has great water resistance which is very convenient when at the pool playing some jams. Any music type sounds great and the mini ""sub woofers"" make for great bass. Couldn't be happier with the portability considering its light enough to strap to my bag when going on a hike."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its incredible,5,I use this everyday at work and the quality is amazing.  I use it a couple hours a day and only charge it over night once a week
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great small speaker with great sound,5,"Perfect speaker for my needs. Just listening to music on go ( camping, beach , backyard events and at home.  Easy to use - great sound - compact - durable and love shade of blue.  I had this on my wishlist for two years finally just bought it myself so glad I did - so much better than listening on my phone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One of the best purchases I've made.,5,"One of the best purchases I've made. This little speaker has a ton of power. I got to use it at a friends house and immediately purchased one for myself.  The battery seems to last a good 10 hours or more as it says it will. I took it on vacation and it did great outdoors, near sand, by the water and inside during movie nights. Fantastic product. I'm actually considering giving these as Christmas gifts this year as I think everyone needs one in their life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,Awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for going to the beach,5,"This portable speaker works well at the beach, picnic, or any other outdoor activity because:- It's small and compact.- Good battery life. (I always bring a battery if it's going to be a long day)- Decent sound (I'm not a sound technician so...)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Delivers,5,Purchased this as a gift and it didn’t disappoint . Good Quality Sound as expected for a JBL Product .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bad quality,5,Was a good speaker for a couple months now it keeps shutting off wont hold battery life i am very upset about it have had this less than a year
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best in class,5,"Have been using JBL products for almost 6/7 years now and still I think they are best in class considering the quality provided at the price offered. Never had doubts about buying JBL4 speakers. Great sound, water resistant and portable. Its my 2nd JBL4 and can buy again!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Hands down the last portable speaker you will ever need,5,"the sound is the best I have ever heard and I have had tons of speakers and this one is the loudest of all of them. battery life is okay, but that is the balance between sound quality to battery life performance."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it! Great sound!,5,"Absolutely love it , light weight for travel , take it everywhere. Love the quality of the sound and the price was great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",actually waterproof,5,My daughter left this speaker outside in the rain for 2 days and it still works perfectly. Pricy but worth the money
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Little speaker, big sound",5,I've used this speaker multiple times and haven't needed to charge it. Sound is great.  We used it for my daughter's softball team warmups and everyone could hear clearly.  I love the size fits into any bag I need.  Would recommend for sure
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Nice sound quality, sturdy built... just one thing...",4,"So, great product, well built, sounds great. There IS an issue with battery saving, which means the speaker will go silent when it does not detect a signal... OR when that signal is too low, like if you have the volume set too low. There should be options to configure this threshold on the app... Which is another issue, not enough (none) configuration options on the App."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good but battery failed after 1 year,4,"The sound quality and volume are excellent, battery life was nice too. Overall excellent for the price but battery started malfunctioning/dying out after about 1 year - ran out really fast while showing full battery after charging (this produced crackling sounds too as the juice ran out).  Other than that, awesome speaker. I'll try to replace the battery."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Favorite speaker I own,5,One of the best speakers I’ve owned. The sound is so worth it. Battery could be better but it can be looked over
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING SOUND QUALITY!!!,5,This potable speaker is such a great value and Im so happy that I purchased it. The sound quality is AMAZING and the battery life lasts for hours! Its also waterproof just incase you have a clumsy friend. A great buy worth every penny.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality!,5,"Not only does this speaker get nice and loud, but the sound quality is crisp and clear"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth IT,5,This little speaker is packed with quality sound. It’s so easy to connect and sounds great indoors and out. Perfect for the price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Couldn't be happier with this!,5,"This Bluetooth speaker is excellent. I also own a Bose Soundlink Mini, which has superb audio, but this is darned good for less than half the money I paid for the Bose. I mainly use this as my office music speaker but have also used it for watching movies. Have never run it out of battery, so am very happy with the battery life. I think its a good deal for the price and it sounds great to me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing purchase,5,"Highly recommend buying it, I’ve had it for a couple of months now and it’s great, the sound quality is amazing!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I should have bought four of these.,5,"I bought two. One for my daughter and one for me. I should have bought four. I've been playing with my Christmas present. On low volume, it has lasted for days. It sounds great turned up on high.  It has yet to die on me (battery). Rich vibrant sound. I haven't tested its water resistance but I plan on testing it on my motorcycle.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"This product is so great! It has great sounds quality, holds its charge, and is so easy to use!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker Well made,4,For the most part they just work.  The only issue I observed is when link mulitple speakers at a party.  If other persons at the party have paired with the speakers as well you may have dropouts on some of the speakers.  Otherwise this is great.  I bought one because my friend had two and they are awesome for parties anywhere.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life sucks,3,Battery life is about an hour
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,Fabulous little speaker with great sound.  Have already used it more than I anticipated.  I purchased the white.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love love love this speaker!,5,This speaker is amazing! The sound quality is so good and it never loses my Bluetooth connection (within my apartment). I honestly think that the sound quality is better than my Sonos One speaker (which cost almost 2-3x more!). I would definitely recommend and buy this speaker again!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth connectivity,5,Cuts off as bluetooth connectivity very fast as you walk further from it.  But besides that it's very good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Most definitely a good buy,5,I loveeeeee my flip is helping us with a large hybrid group of in person and zoom the audio for video conferencing is crystal clear
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,5,Great for the money.  I really like it.  Use it on the boat and in the garage all the time
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Top Flight,5,"Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this speaker. Powerful enough without sounding distorted.  You get good enough base and clarity and that's all you can  ask for at this price point. Absolutely a great purchase and to me, better than some  of the newer models honestly. Buy this version and save yourself some money from the overbloated newer versions!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best speaker,5,This is hands down the best speaker I've ever bought. Once you pair it to your phone it connects automatically every time you turn it on. The sound is very loud for its size. Not to mention it can connect to other JBLs and have an even louder sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great little speaker, to jam the day away!!",5,"This is my 2nd JBL flip, my kids bought my first for Christmas 2-3years ago...I Love it!! Great sound quality, all around: just a good speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great, Quality Sound Speaker!",5,"I wish I had purchased one sooner! The sound quality is great, the battery last quite a while, and the color is gorgeous! I love that it’s waterproof so I can have it with me when I’m doing laps in the pool!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, but....",3,"I have one Flip 4 and am very satisfied with the sound quality so I purchased a 2nd one to link them together for stereo sound and increase the listening area around the house but the JBL Connect feature did not work well (when it worked at all).  Tried pairing the speakers using JBL Connect on two iPhones, they connected but the sound was distorted and often cut out.  Using it on my laptop did not work at all.  Streaming to the first speaker works well as designed but when I pushed the buttons to connect them, it simply disconnected the first speaker from the laptop.  Instructions are nothing more than a few graphics with no troubleshooting guide.  Rather than calling a support number and spending more time listening to recordings, UPS has it now and I'll just be content with the single speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little bluetooth speaker,5,Awesome in small parties impressive sound cool design
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big clear sound from a small speaker,5,We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this speaker. So easy to set up and use. Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","(new used 1 time) even plugged in after charge, battery/charger won't last! Speaker won't play..",3,"Sounds is fantastic! Fully charged the JBL speaker, started using it with my pixel phone, when JBL speaker was about 1/2 full, I plugged it in to charge while listening... What A surprise when the JBL speaker completely drained and won't play even with the brand new JBL speaker plugged in! Does this make sense????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect sound!!!!!,5,LOVE JBL! And now this waterproof one makes it even better! Great deal on sale as well! The sound is amazing! Clear and loud if desired!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful speaker,5,"Easy to use, great sound, and battery charge lasts a really long time.  Love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,4,Purchased as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. I have a Bose Mini Soundlink II and this speaker is very comparable in size and sound quality with Bose having a slight upper hand in my opinion. But this speaker is also more rugged and cheaper.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelent purchase,5,"Buying this on Amazon was excelent because it was cheaper then other places,sound is amazing"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",100 percent satisfied,5,I love it the sound is great and battery lasts a really long time to and portable berry happy with the product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A must have portable speaker,5,Great quality and for playing music on the field during soccer practice. It could be heard to an extent from the entire field if volume is turnt all the way up. I’ve dropped it and kept in inside a bag many times and it’s very durable. Perfect if you want to jam out in the shower without worrying about water damage to the speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It was a gift,5,A gift.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I LOVE MY JBL!!,5,"I bought this speaker shortly after my Dad had bought one and I found I was using it more than him because it was so fantastic! The two bass speakers on the side are pretty booming for its small, compact size. The quality of sound is more than a bang for your buck. The nice thing about this speaker is that it's water resistant, and can be charged and played at the same time (which wasn't possible with my old Sony speaker). Definitely an essential if you're a student who loves their music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",it worth your money.....,4,Sounds great and really loud with bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, perfect size!",4,"Loving this little speaker so far! Good size, tough in the elements, and fits in my bike's bottle cage!! Took it to the beach and really liked being able to connect two phones at a time so we could take turns picking songs. The battery was also great and it lasted the entire day! Could use a little more bass, but I'm not complaining given the small size. I would definitely recommend and may even buy a second one!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better then expected,5,Turned it on connect the Bluetooth through my smartphone and worked perfectly. The sound is awesome with clear crisp mediums and highs. The base is where I thought it is better then expected. I would never have expected the base to be so clear from such a small box. Totally recommend this for outside of anywhere like in the shower or at the pool. We even used it on a hike.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not the original but ok,5,"I have owned the first JBL Flip for many years now and used it daily unfortunately the battery just can't keep up like it used to. I decided to purchase the JBL Flip 4 because of my prior experiences. It's good and is water proof(does not float) I t is not a loud and clear as the original, but it does have the option to connect multiple units together to achieve stereo even a sorts of surround sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to connect and great sound!,5,My children love their music and they can definitely hear it as can the neighbors. Thanks for a great affordable product that is easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound is great!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",High quality speaker for on the go,5,"My daughter bring this to every practice with her. easy to connect and great sound quality. Small enough to pack in a bag, purse or backpack."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Greatest speaker!,5,"Great sounding speaker. I am not an audiophile, so this review is just for ordinary people looking for a great speaker. As soon as you get the box you can tell it's a great product. Comes very nice and packaged securely. Very easy to connect took less than a minute. As soon as I had it up and running I can easily say it's one of the best speakers for this price range. No distortions at high volume, deep and rich bass. Overall great speaker. Highly recommended it to anyone who likes clear and loud music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING,5,I bought this speaker for my daughter because she wanted one and i will be buying one for each of the family member. We loving this speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Replace cable asap the one that come with it is TERRIBLE!!!!,5,Good sound. Great battery life. The recharge cable is Garbage!!!! I had to replace it in 3 months.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better off with the flip 3,5,Perfect little speaker. Previously had the 3. Waited for this one to go one sale during Christmas.  One feature  I'm not too fond of is they added little circles on the ends that pulse with the base. So it effects  the sound if you stand it on its end. The 3 had better sound. Still happy with the purchase though
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound is great!,5,Love it!! This speaker really delivers. I use it with all my music apps. Bluetooth connects easy and battery lasts a long time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound quality,4,I was very upset to inbox it and see that I was sent the black on because I ordered the teal and I also waited longer than the two days to receive it so I not wanting to send it back to wait even longer for a new one. I really like this speaker though the sound on it is amazing and it’s very simple to use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really Surprised!,5,"I bought this for the beach, and it worked well! Since I don’t have anything to listen to at work I took it to the office. I was really surprised at the sound quality at the beach and it only got better in my office. So far the battery has lasted all week, I take it home on Friday nights and charge it for the weekend! I would definitely buy this one again!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Sound is very good. I use it in kitchen while I do boring chores. Delivered well packaged and on time. No complaints.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,Everything about this product is amazing especailly for metal and death metal if youre on edge about buying it i would reccommend it its a lil pricey but its a little taller than a monster drink and weighs more sound quality is fantastic double pedal sounds good and the guitar is clear and amazing its overall great havent had time to test battery on a timer or anything but for casually listening its great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Speaker - love how easy it is to pair.,5,Great sound for a little portable speaker. Love this and have purchased multiples for different rooms. Attaches easily to echo dot for a nice speaker boost.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Satisfied,4,so far I like everything about this product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the buy,5,I have used it twice now for beach days. It lasts hours on full blast and is loud. Only thing is after a while it starts to disconnect its self from bluetooth. Not sure if that's from being in the sun. But it's totally worth the buy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and waterproof,5,"Bought two for the wife and I to take to the beach and to use on our paddle board trips. For a small speaker they produce great sound and they can get really loud with no distortion. They are small and so far durable. My only complaint is the pairing mode. When using both our speakers paired, one will cut out frequently even when they are stationary sitting 5 ft away from each other."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The ease of use and sound.,5,I love it. I listen to a lot of meditation music and this goes everywhere with me.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this!,5,"How can something so loud come out of something so cute? I love this, it was a great buy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker great sound !!,5,"I thought I had lost my flip 3 which was a gift but luckily I found it, now having 2 the connectivity is doubled! :)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Powerful, portable, good sound quality",5,"This is the one you want. The speaker is powerful enough to make conversation difficult in my kitchen, and it's indispensable camping gear. Surprisingly good bass response for such a small speaker. Battery life is good. I don't know exactly how many hours you get out of it, but I use it for many days between charges. Pairing devices via blue tooth is a breeze. Spring for the carrying case; you'll be glad you did."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s a great deal,5,Good base good treble and loud enough to enjoy without distortion I recommend this speaker that is waterproof
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,"Clear sound, love it but I do miss my bose mini link... I'm a bass listener"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker.  Dead at 3 years,3,"Purchased in April 2018.  Worked well until several months ago (3 years of use).  Battery doesn’t hold charge anymore and speaker sounds blown.It was a great speaker, though.  Many trips to the lake on the dock, kayak, 4 wheeler, hot tub.  Good sound quality and volume.  Easy Bluetooth connectivity.Gonna try a UE boom 3 next."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The internal microphone work fine when talking to some one through it,4,"play very well however did not have anything to really compare it to.  if the music loud coming from your device it will be loud coming out of the JBL Flip 4  but it will not enhance the volume it has to be already recorded high if not the sound will be low, if the recording is low. that's why I give it 4 star.  The internal microphone work fine when talking to some one through it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Tamaño vs sonido,4,Es facil de trasladarLa bateria dura poco
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice little Bluetooth speaker,5,Really surprised that the sound that comes out of this little speaker. Jbl's always built great products though. No problem so far will update if anything pops up.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speakers,5,"The sound is great! Totally blown away by it.The only thing odd is that it doesn't have a real ""resting"" side to it..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great speaker. Sound quality is great. Battery life is good can last almost all day on lake playing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the Buy.,5,This speaker is worth the buy. Had it for several months and I work in the oil field. I was going through other speakers regularly because the charging ports would break. This speaker is definitely loud enough and it’s working components have withstood a lot longer than the others. Cosmeticlly it’s taken some damage and a few of the button icons have fell off but they still work and that’s what’s important.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome little speaker,5,I bought this one as a gift since I liked mine so much. Easy to use and quick connectivity.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound for such a compact little speaker.,5,"Great for the beach, camping or just sitting outside on the patio..Small,, light easy to take along."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker bad battery,3,When I got this speaker I was under the impression that it would last for my entire work day which is 10 hours. Much to surprise and disappointment it was dead in 4. I fully charge it every night it never lasted longer than that. I have to keep it plugged in to get any sort of longevity. The sound of pretty good though.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Toddler resistant,5,"Great great great!!!Sound, battery life are outstanding!I have a toddle who walks around with the speaker listening to music and dropping/throwing it any chance she gets. After a month of very very very frequent drops its working great and no dents or scratches."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sauce!,5,"Great for the patio, work and even on the bike. Sounds wonderful and lasts all day on a single charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Little Speaker!,5,"I bought the first one for my husband and he loves it! We even took it with us on a cruise to the Caribbean.  Just bought a second one for my dad's Christmas gift because he really liked my husband's and again, it did not disappoint! My father even took it on a trip to Mexico and he is loving it! So glad for this little gadget! Will definitely come back to get a third soon!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Blown speaker now,3,I had this for a out a year and a half before it blew and sounds like rattling garbage. Oh well at least it was a cheap one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL and Harman Kardon what a match...,5,"The sound is incredible it's just plain jaw-dropping.... Highs , lows , middles..... Perfection from something so small and it's loud as you wanted to be..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",As advertised,5,It works as advetized. I got 2 and love the feature that they can be synchronized
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Play with it,5,Good powerful sound that can be transported easily. Splashed water on it and had zero issues. Price is worth it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"I had doubts initially due to the price but this thing is perfect for the pool! It's waterproof so no more worries for us near the pool area or even if we happen to leave it outside. One of the best things is it will also connect to another JBL so make it THAT much louder!! I have been using this speaker all summer, dropped it into the pool once for a couple minutes and still it works like the first day!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL knows how to make em,5,"Love it, the sound is pretty good on it for such a small speaker and the bass isn’t lacking either I highly recommend it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love the sound it is very awesome,5,I love this Bluetooth speaker it is awesome the sound is amazing the battery life is good I’m very pleased
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Full powered speaker in the palm of your hand!,5,"This is the best thing I have ever bought for myself! Now I can listen to music in the bathroom when I shave my legs. Fantastic sound quality! Great Bluetooth range (I can keep my non water resistant phone out of the are fore mentioned bath area). Worth every cent! I’m a musician and I trust JBL for my big sound system, I’m so happy to find the brand’s smaller components are just as lovely. Highly recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,3,"The product is very good, sound quality is perfect the battery life is the only thing that sucks. If you have it at our full Max sound you might get 3 hrs of music. You might get 6 hrs if you have it on low or  medium volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Honest Opinion,5,"I will review this on my YouTube channel.My experience with the flip4 is a good one.This speaker most definitely worth it.The sound quality is as good as if not better than next level speakers.I always bought like Bose speakers and I'm glad I purchased this one,if you're looking for great sound for a little less it's a deal."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best in price and amazing sound,5,"This is the perfect size, it holds a long charge, I use it daily and the sound is incredible!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Long battery and decent sound,5,Works decent not the best sound quality but I cannot expect it to be. Overall it is very good and has a long battery life that actually surprised me. Very happy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I would give three thumbs up if I had another one.,5,"Sound quality is perhaps not the best I've heard but if I consider its formfactor, it produces a good quality sound.  Small enough to fit in your hand (holding).  Less buttons but does all needed such as skipping pausing etc.  Use it a lot in my showers and vocal sound is pretty clear listening to audiobooks/podcasts.  Design is also beautiful.  I find it masculine.  Nice it has a holding string/hook."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ask me later for a more honest review,4,"I would love to say more, so give me time to use it. Then it will be more effective to give a review. So far so good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Smaller but still great!,4,"Super nice and high quality speaker. My only thing for me is that it’s a lot smaller than the previous JBL version but the sound quality is as good but it was for my daughter, who wanted the same size as her older sisters’ ones so she was a little dissapointed but other than that it’s great and sturdy and sounds super good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality,5,The sound quality is amazing and the volume goes up pretty loud. I got this as a present for my husband and he loves it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Mighty Mouse,5,Great device! Works Awesome in my old truck. Yes I use it as my vehicle stereo... why not? My truck isn't exactly the quietest automobile so it has stood up to the test of who is louder. So far so good with the JBL Flip4. Everything was packages nice nothing seemed to be defective or used. Shipping was a little behind schedule but hey... caca happens out there on the road. I definitely will buy a 2nd one in the near future... that's if it holds up for what I use it for over the summer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,Great sound quality!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bass? Where is it?,3,"Kind of disappointed in the lack of bass and how quiet this speaker is, the background music on it is very quiet even at full volume the teal is very pretty though. Considering it's a jbl I had higher expectations for the flip 4 but I should have just bought  new ue boom."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We can both hear the podcast out on the back deck,5,"This Bluetooth speaker works great! We spend lots of time out on the back deck and the iPad's built-in speakers are not loud enough even on a quiet day in the neighborhood. The Flip 4 not only lets us both hear the sound but it gives us the low end and clarity that is lacking in the iPad speakers. Making a Bluetooth connection can't be easier than this. The weight is right, as well. It stays put where we place it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A lot of bang for your buck,5,This little speaker packs a lot of high quality sound to be so small. There is absolutely nothing I don't like about it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little monster,5,Bought this for my partner.  Exceeds all expectations.  Great sound... especially for its size.  Would not hesitate to buy another or recommend it.  Bluetooth connection happened in a flash.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,I was completely satisfied with this speaker I would definitely recommend this to everyone also I’m thinking of buying more
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jbl,5,Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it!,5,The Bluetooth is great. The battery life is long and sound quality is awesome!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Honest Pros and Cons,3,Pros;- Portable size- Affordable priceCons;- I have an older iPhone 6 that can't update to iOS 13.  To use the Amazon Music app iOS 13 is needed.- Bluetooth 4.  That means not the best at latency or connective distances.- The sound is just OK.  I've heard other Bluetooth speakers that can deliver better sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker just doesn't suit my purposes,3,"I got this in preparation for a century bike ride.  I like everything about it except the volume.  It doesn't get as loud as the Wonderboom.  I want something that I can hear above road noise and wind.  This might do the trick but I don't want to get on the the road and find it gets drowned out by road noise, especially when I know that there is another product that delivers more volume.  It is also not drop resistant, a definite plus for bike riding.If I were purchasing for sound quality, it would be the JBL Flip4 hands down, as I am very very picky about sound quality. But out on the road volume trumps quality.Bottom line, the volume and sound quality is good for normal use.  But if you driving factor is volume, I'd pick something else."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for my uses,5,"I use this to blast music throughout my house when I clean or am just hanging out. I don't think I've even gotten close to its volume capabilities, and it has been plenty loud. The sound is clear and bright. The charge holds for a pretty long time, helped out by the automatic shut off feature. You could take this on a trip without the charger and not worry about it losing charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound,5,This speaker is little but mighty!  Sound is amazing. Definite a GREAT speaker!  And it’s waterproof! Love love love it!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must be reset if multiple users!,5,For whatever reason it like the first one stopped pairing and the power light is blinking blue.. conflicted information on how to solve on the internet. Wish someone  had an answer. These are great otherwise.Updated:You must turn on and quickly (after the 2 audible beeps) press the volume up and the play/ pause buttons simultaneously.Then restart itI almost returned it before finding the way to reset
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth getting,5,Went with this one instead of the Flip5 because it can sync with more speakers unlike Flip5 that isn't backwards compatible and it has the ports I needed for connecting to older devices.Sounds great! Used this for hours and hours outdoors for a 2 day camping trip and did not have to charge it until a couple days after getting back home.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stopped charging after 4 months,1,"I bought my JBL Flip 4 in May as a supplement to my laptop's weak speakers. I've used it almost every day since but never took it outside, exposed it to water, heat, etc. It's literally been in my air conditioned house this whole time. In mid September, it stopped holding a charge. I did some testing to eliminate other variables and I'm confident that it's the speaker and not the cord, outlet, or anything else. $80+ down the drain and it's too late to return but much too early for a speaker this expensive to be having issues. Do not recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is great when I'm talking on the phone,5,I use this device to be hands free when I'm talking on the phone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Phenomenal Sound,5,"This product is absolutely amazing! My wife and I just purchased this and have gone through many a bluetooth speaker. The sound this product provides is exceptional! My wife also loves bass, in music, and this speaker does wonderfully in regards to providing phenomenal bass. We will definitely be buying more of these in the very near future!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a small speaker!,5,"We have three of these shared in our family! Great for beach parties, mountain trips and picnics at the park! Highly recommend! Buy a case for it too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Love this speaker! Has great sound quality and holds a charge for a very long time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice Purchase and delivery,5,Great. Happy Holidays
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip 4,5,"I have 3 of these speakers and am totally satisfied with the quality. Use in car,shower and outside picnics,sun bathing, fishing; anywhere"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",not that great tbh,3,"I'm old and I still listen to ""dubstep"" now called Trap. Whatever. It's heavy bass. I like heavy grinding bass. This little thing has too much bass. I didn't think it was possible, but it drowns out most of the treble. I can't hear vocals or strings very well. I wish there was a way to adjust it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Okay speaker, Bluetooth connectivity is lacking",3,"I like the speaker, however the Bluetooth connectivity is a little weak for the price. It gets cut up audio from time to time even if the device is right next to it. I’ve tried multiple phones too so I can’t really blame it on the phones at this point. Indoor or outdoor, same issues"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker.,5,"Excellent speaker. The sound is high quality, and the durability is the best I have found yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lleva escrito hecho en vietnam,4,Parece imitacion..pero aun asi es bueno
"JBL Flip 4, Black",BEST PRODUCT,5,I'm in softball and use music on the bus and this reaches from the back to the front of the bus love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good deal,4,"Works well, not quite as loud as a charge but for being smaller its really good!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL speakers.....enough said,4,Back in high school I purchased a set of JBL studio speakers for my home stereo system which bought an amazing listening experience to the music.  This small portable bluetooth speaker packs the punch in sound quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would like the volume to higher than it does \w/.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,Love the sound of the speaker. Its loud and clear. The bass is good as well. Worth the price under $100
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome little speaker,5,Great purchase.  This is a awesome little speaker.  Loud sound for such a small speaker.  Would highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, battery could be better",4,"The sound is what you'd expect from JBL, solid and full. Battery could be better, but it does allow you to charge while playing. What I personally don't really like is that it doesn't really stand well, it keeps rolling and if you place it on one of the sides, it affects the sound quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ok,4,Ok for price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Replacing the battery: I can’t do it,1,"I loved this speaker until the battery died. It lasted over a year.  Neither the speaker or the replacement lithium battery came with instructions on how to replace the battery.  I found how-to videos on YouTube.  I STRONGLY URGE you look at those videos before you purchase this speake.  I could barely get the cover off, and I cannot get the screws out.  This speaker is now a very expensive paper weight."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy it!  You’ll like it!,5,"Nice product.  I’ve only had it for a couple of hours, but it was easy to charge, connect and listen.  Very user friendly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Convenient,5,"It’s great for travel and and if you want to listen to music without very loud bass, the bass is excellent but I think the bigger model after this bass hits a lot harder, I like this one for early mornings or to go hiking it’s not too loud and the other one is nice for parties"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"I like it so much that I’ll take it with me all the time, not only camping as intended the first time when I both it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The gifter,5,"My beorhwr owned a Bose system, but now suddenly loves this gift I gave him!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker Makes Perfect Grad Present!,5,This is a great speaker and the second one we buy. Easy to connect to and made a great graduation present
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Use this speaker every day,5,"I use it when I start the day in the bath room, outside with friends, even when I travel. Fantastic, and solid sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",??????????????,4,LOVE IT!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't have to sacrifice sound quality for volume,5,"Phenominal bass for such a little speaker. Sound quality is very impressive, and it doesn't get fuzzy when turned up to the max. Hands down best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned. Almost got one of the bose speakers because a friend had one and I really liked it, but went with the JBL based on reviews and noe that I have it and listened to music on it I know I made the better choice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker! Unfortunately didn’t hold up.,3,"I bought this speaker about a year ago, its a great little soeaker with good sound quality/volume. I have used it quite a few times around the water and it has not had an issuue. It quickly became my go to Bluetooth speaker, with a good size for just stuffing into a backpack to bring along. Unfortunately recently it took a bit of a fall from the perch I had it set on out in the campsite, from that moment on it hasn’t worked the same and the volume/quality was ruined. It fell about 2’ but its built well so I fogured it would be fine, unfortunately that wasn’t the case. Speaker would be 5/5 if this hadn’t happened, since then I havee brought speaker to be recycled since it no longer works to the level it had in the past, back to my old bose Bluetooth speaker :( :("
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not waterproof,3,"Sound is great, never had a problem with battery life. But it’s definitely not water proof! Got knocked into the shallow end of the pool, wasn’t in the water more than 5 seconds and now it won’t work. If it wasn’t advertised as waterproof I’d take the loss and buy another."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,I’ve been a big fan of JBL products for years. This speaker did not disappoint!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,This is the third JBL speaker I have purchased for my family members.. great speakers
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Such incredible clarity, I love the rich highs and lows I am very satisfied.",5,I liked everything about it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth speaker,5,"I bought this speaker for the bathroom. Sound quality is great, even when turned up loud.  Battery charge life is surprisingly long.  I don’t have any complaints and am glad I purchased this speaker.  If I had to find something negative, I think it’s a little lacking in bass, but it’s much better than other similar speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good bluetooth speakers,5,So I read all the reviews about the people who have trouble being able to charge their Bluetooth speaker after a few charges. It's probably because they're stupid enough to keep the USB cord charging in the speaker while playing at the same time. Don't do that you idiots! I don't have a problem with charging my speakers because I don't do that. I love these speakers I'm glad I bought them and it's a great investment.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,Not as good as the previous model but still a great speaker. Smaller. Perfect for backyard BBQ's!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Great sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product,5,"Sound and build quality, ease of use and good reputation. Good buy for high quality speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can't go wrong with JBL,5,"This is the 2nd JBL speaker I've had, the first being a Clip2 I got about 3 years ago which has had almost daily use and continues to go strong with only just recently showing signs of the battery starting to wear out. So far the Flip4 has been great. Super loud, good clarity and bass. Battery life is excellent, my phone will go dead before this thing will. Haven't had the need to test how waterproof it is though yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very satisfied.,5,"Product sound quality is excellent, and battery life is outstanding! Supplier of product delivered as promised, and description of same was spot on. I would recommend this device, and supplier."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommend!,4,"I have not had my Flip for very long but so far so good. It is a high quality electronic from the packaging to the unit. The loudness and quality of sound are very good considering the size product. The only improvement I can think of is that it doesn’t come with a carrying case, I had to purchase one separate and this is why I held one star."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy. A bit over my budget,5,"I enjoy this speaker, It has a good battery life (about 12 hours of use at a moderate volume enough for me to hear it in another room) bluetooth connectivity has a wide range. Totally recommend if it is in your budget. If not consider it. I don't regret this buy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy,5,Bought it for my teenage daughter and she loves it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Happy with my purchase,5,"Amazing sound quality, bluetooth connectivity is seemless and battery life is pretty good. Must must buy if this fits your budget."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",6 month up date,5,"Sound amazing might and day better soundHowever, I purchased this with the ideal I could expand to two Bluetooth speakers or more. This speaker will not connect to Flip 5.If you purchase with the promise of connecting more speakers.Garbage, disappointment. I would like my money back I would love to return this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!,5,Got if as a gift and it is a great portable speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,"As expected...this product meets full JBL quality sound and build. Small speaker, but packs some heavy lows!! Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good. Overall, I’m quite satisfied with this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent and affordable...,5,"We own another model of this JBL speaker, and this one performed as expected... Excellent sound and quality for the size..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker!,5,"I absolutely love this speaker, it's 100% worth the money. The speaker got VERY loud and has such intense bass yet so much clarity. There is no static with this speaker. I have no tried it around water, so I cannot test the claims that it is water resistant. The only thing is I wish this speaker came with is a case, but that is nit-picking. This was an awesome purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Distortion on higher volume.,3,Battery life is good. Paired with my iPhone 11 easily. Is pretty nice looking. If i needed to play it loud a lot i would of returned it. It has too much distortion on higher volume. Very disappointed. Fortunately i don’t play it loud a lot.  Also don’t have enough time to take it to the post office to scoop it back.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Military HMMWV,3,"Good sound, the speaker did break when accidentally dropped off a hood, I needed a louder speaker to hear over the engine of the HMMWV so I bought a ""boombox"" from the Walmart.Great for regular use just doesn't do what I needed it to for military use"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good mini speaker,4,These are good little speakers. If you can connect more than one it's really loud. It has pretty good sound quality and the bass hits hard than I thought it would. Good job!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice On The Go Speaker,5,I purchased this item for my fiance for Christmas this year. He is very happy with the quality of the sound and how light the speaker is for easy travel and movement from room to room when working around the house. We are excited to bring it along with us to our summer adventures this year at the pool and campgrounds we spend most of our time and wanted good loud speaker to listen to.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful Yet Compact !,5,Super sound for a compact speaker! Easy to take with you and enjoy quality sound with your favorite music or podcast!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and lightweight,5,"Love it! Portable, easy to use and charge. Highly recommend"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent for sitting around in close quarters.,4,Loud for listening on the back porch within close distance. Not loud enough to hear over the waverunner or over about 30ft away outdoors
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic Beach Accessory!!!,5,"We used this speaker all summer at the beach. It get wet, buried in the sand, and dropped a few times. Still works great! Really like the durability, sound, and convenient size. This little package packs a punch! Highly recommend!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality sound,5,"Teen son loves it. Has used it only indoors so far but is able to play clear sound from his projector that is like surround in the condo. I also got him the carrying case which he loves and plans to take on trips or to the field when he plays catch. Got this on Black Friday deal, worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery only lasted about 3 1/2 hours just like the JBL flip 3,4,I bought this thinking that the battery would last about 6 to 8 hours on full blast....it did notOnly lasted about 3hours..just like the JBL flip 3.Don't get me wrong...the JBL flip 3 and 4 are great speakers...But the only reason I bought the JBL flip 4 was because I read a review that said the battery lasted 6 to 8 hours..but sadly it did not.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift. Battery lasts forever and it sounds great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,5,Love this speaker. Bought for use at lake.  Easy to Conner and very potable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good baterry life,5,"Not going to act like a sound guru, it's low, i hear the base and the battery lasts"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound and bass is important to me!,5,Great speaker & still sounds good almost 2 years later!!!  Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",8 months and broken,5,"Loved it, however, I bought it in the middle of April and it's the beginning of December and it no longer works, won't reset, Dead. Seems like it should last longer than 8 months."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,4,Sounds great. works great. syncs perfectly with no issues. Bought 4 of these as presents for my cousins and they loved it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So not impressed,1,"I bought one of these a few weeks and used it maybe 5 times. It would randomly shut off or disconnect, and had to be resynced every time I used it. The last time I tried using it, it wouldn’t even turn on. Needless to say, I decided to exchange, and try another one, in hopes that it’s just a random defective one. The new one came today, and I opened the shipping  box and the inner actual product packaging is cover with a goopy slime that smells like tiger balm. I grabbed a paper towel and scissors to open it, in hopes that it was just on the outside, but there was a quarter inch thick of this mysterious menthol goop on the inside. It burned my eyes to even have it open. I quickly sealed it up and am sending it right back. I am absolutely mind blown that that would even get sent to me. My boyfriend used to work for Amazon’s warehouse for many years. I understand the amount of hands these packages have to go through before they are shipped. The negligence in quality control here is appalling."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Sound from a Small Speaker,5,"I love JBL, as a retired Professional DJ I mostly used JBL speakers in my performances and this little speaker works great. I do notice it's blue-tooth range is shorter than an earlier model I had, but this is my second JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black, so I do stand by them for what they're made to do."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy,5,So far it is working great. Good sound quality and gets loud enough for what I need
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,This is my third. My kids keep taking them as they sound so good. Water resistant is handy by the pool.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Product is better than expected.  It has good bass for its size and cost.  Great product.I recommend this product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cant go wrong with JBL,5,It was intended to be a gift and my wife uses it just about daily. JBL always comes through with good stuff.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker I have owned,5,"I love this speaker so much and it BUMPS. The battery life is great I have had it 2 weeks and use it daily and just had to charge it for the first official time yesterday. I love using it when I work out and use the pool. Also i have to recommend the Echo input is excellent I turned the speaker into a wicked awesome ""alexa"". Love it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,This is a great product...i took it to the beach and the power lasted all day long
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality,5,"This speaker packs a punch! Especially if you place it in a corner of a room, the sound just amplifies! I've even put it in a deep cardboard box (when I was moving) and wow! The bass gets deeper!  Try placing it under your kitchen cabinet in the corner and the sound is amazing.  Not bad for the size.  And it's rugged too.  Definitely worth the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its a very good product,5,Its the best speaker I've bought all the other ones i bought broke so this is one of the best ones I bought its very good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL is the way to go...,5,I am in love with my JBL flip four speaker! I researched a lot of websites to find the best deal of course Amazon out beat everyone. I’m a prime customer so it came within two days and I take it with me everywhere- to the gym that beach... everywhere. The sound is great nice and clear and crisp and it has bass so it really gets the going!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great,5,This is the most amazing Bluetooth speaker. Fantastic product! It came much quicker than I expected.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy for the $$$,5,"Great Sound, durable and exactly what is advertised. Happy with my purchase and highly recommend it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Bought this to replace my Flip 3. Use it daily. Great sound easy connectivity to Bluetooth
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,"All the way around, a high quality speaker. The battery life isn’t what I was expecting but still an amazing speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Let’s the beat go on !,5,The sound quality is great and length of charge is quit good .glad we got one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound in a small package with decent battery life.,5,"I got this at Christmas time for a good price. I think engineers who fit such good sound into such a small package are genius. The sound quality is at least as good as the Wonderboom I use at work. I am not sure how durable it is since it sits on a desk and I haven’t had occasion to test it in water. Overall, I highly recommend this. It just works as promised."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love my speaker,5,"Omg, I love my little speaker! I don’t know why anyone would give it a bad review regarding this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s not really loud,4,I liked the packaging but it wasn’t as loud as I thought it would be
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!!,5,Great speaker to use pretty much anywhere.  Connecting to bluetooth was a breeze and for how small the speaker is it has really good sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud and clear in a big shop,5,"I got this to listen to in my big open bay shop that's pretty loud, and it's perfect."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s alright,2,It worked good for three months now suddenly it keeps cutting off
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product and good price.,5,We have been happy with the sound quality and battery life. Would recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Sound, survived a kayakong float.",5,"So far this bluetooh speaker os legit. I got it to take on kayaking trips.  Have not thrown it in the water,  but it did get a little wet and no issues. The sound quality is good. Better then my first JBL (which, i still love and it is 5years old), and Bose bluetooth speaker. I took the string off and tied a floater to it because it is my understanding that it does not float."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get it - it's worth it !,5,"That a lot of sound comes out of a speaker this size isn't that big a deal - lots of small speakers are loud now. But the quality of that sound is second to none - that's a rarity. It has a fullness that you wouldn't expect from something this small. While certainly not the cheapest, you'll absolutely get a first rate product. Battery life is great too - especially if you listen at normal volumes. You won't regret getting this one !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,"WOW!! Very high quality!  Played it all day/ evening for Christmas Eve and could not get over how incredible this one small speaker sounds.  We are thrilled with it. Can play it very loud- and bass is rich and clear. I’ve only had it for one day but for initial use the battery lasted for over 8 hours.I took it outside today to see how it sounded out there and again, AMAZING."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Value,4,Product functions the way it should I bought it for my wife to use in the shower and it does. We also use it out on the deck on nice nights. Versatile and has better than expected sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Must buy product ????,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Extremely satisfied with this JBL Bluetooth speaker, very affordable and i would recommend this to anyone looking for good quality, and inexpensive."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente producto,5,Tiene una amplificación de sonido muy buena. La conectividad es rápida y en tiempo real
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Like the sound and bass is nice too will definitely keep up with jbl
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely best speaker ever,5,I love this speaker. I got it for my gaming pc that didn’t come with speakers so I picked this bad boy up and have been using it for everything
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I expected,5,"Great sound. Haven't used enough to rate battery life, buy I can say i jammed on the beach for quite some time and no issues"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome quality,5,This is the 4th Jbl speaker I have purchased for different people including myself and hands down the best speaker we have owned
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent portable speaker,5,"This is an amazing speaker.  I've used it multiple times on our back patio, around bonfires, working around the house and more.  As long as you have a good wireless network, this connects flawlessly and sounds great!  For the price, I highly recommend it.  If your expectations are higher, then spend more money on something else.  For me, this is perfect for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",If you have problems..they will resolve them nicely. Recommend.,5,"I bought it in may. About half a year after I started hearing weird noises, battery was discharging in few minutes and was disconnecting from my Bluetooth. Called customer serivice. They nicely talked to me and gave me a brand new one. I bought extra insurance from Amazon but still have no idea what its for. The insurance that I had to deal with was from JBL originally. (1 year warranty that JBL has)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy for what you get.,4,Could use a little more volume.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy buy buy buy,5,Very good sound quality very long life battery when you’re using it it will use the battery when you’re not using it will be disconnected and you will saving lots of battery life in the week I have just charged one time so it’s very good recommended
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product great sound,5,The sound is amazing love that it’s portable use it on the right boat all the time definitely would recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and long battery life,5,"Love this speaker, the sound is crisp and loud! I purchased the white one (Bad idea, as it gets dirty easily) but regardless of that, the sound is great, battery life is surprisingly long! I bought to use it later this year while I am on my honeymoon, so, I have no yet tested its resistance with water, even though I will be kept at a chair while at the beach. So far, I enjoy this product, i definitely recommend it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Thought it was the larger one,3,Just received in the mail and bought on sale for $59. I have had the larger one and though this was the same speaker. This one is substantially smaller. Sound seems to be fine so far. We will see. Just feel like it was false advertised. I would have given a better rating if it were accurately advertised.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Clear,5,Not loud and for 39 bucks more you can get one twice its size at Walmart same brand
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sound,5,"Good sounds, just right for the beach"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",love it.,5,"I am having so much fun with this.  I can get music from a variety of sources, and it has a great range, that I don't need to keep my phone near it while I am using this at the pool."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great!,5,Perfect for traveling to the beach! I would recommend buying with a case because they’re helpful too!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it !,5,This is my first time purchasing a JBL speaker & man I freakin love it !! The sound & base is badass . I'm glad I bought it . In my opinion I think it's better than beats but people react to speakers differently.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not a JBL audio file,3,I had purchased one and liked it so much I purchased a second. I paired them so I had a left and right channel and loved it. My only complaint now is on occasion one of the speakers cuts in and out. Not what I had in mind.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Little Unit, Big Sound",5,Used for outside playing of music at a lake house. Sound is very good and clear.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent speaker,4,"Speaker is well built. Although it is decently loud, I expected a tad bit of more Bass for a JBL. Says 12 hours of play, but highly doub it, I fully charged it and played it for about 4 hours before it was less than half way. Overall I am happy with it and will be keeping it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the price,5,I use this at work and I’m happy with it. My only complaint is the battery only lasts about 3 hours.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use,5,"So easy to take it with you use it when you want. One button turns it on and one button turns it off, so useful"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Probably the best waterproof speaker available right now.,5,"I wanted a Bose speaker, but the waterproof version did not stand up to the Bose sound standard in my opinion. This JBL Flip 4 isn't up to the Bose sound standard either, but is not only adequate for the intended use, but better sounding than the waterproof Bose speaker. Easy to use and carry. Quick to connect to bluetooth. I really like how well it works with my phone. Long battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds a lot better than I have imagined, however...",3,"The device, as far as sound quality and construction goes, is flawless. Sounds a lot better than I have imagined, loud, crisp and with enough bass without being way too much (some other speakers I found them poorly balanced, with too much bass).This being said, there is one thing that managed to really really bothered me, after owning this speaker for several months, and even makes me want to sell it sometimes: Each time the speaker turns on, turns off, or connects to a device, it plays REALLY loud sounds. Really loud sounds you cannot change nor disable. A really poor design decision that makes me think twice before considering buying another JBL speaker. I would recommend you to watch video reviews to listen to the sound and evaluate yourself if you want to wake up your family or neighbors every time you turn on your speaker at 2AM."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Lil Speaker,5,"Not to sound like an old man, but the sound is excellent for the size of this fella. Picked up the Camo version and it looks great, fits perfectly in my bicycle water bottle cage and puts out some amazing sound. What else can you ask for - maybe have the buttons highlighted or a different color to easily identify - not worth a Star though. Best water bottle cage speaker for the price IMHO."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,Fantastic speaker for golf! Love it! Battery life is great. Sound is great! BUY THIS SPEAKER WITH NO REGRETS!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Purchase!!,5,"I LOVE these speakers. The sound quality is good enough for me, the Bluetooth connectivity is easy and so is the battery life. I’m glad I purchased these."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound and battery life is awesome,5,I use this for work i drive forklift and wow at medium volume i get about 10 hrs out of it  which i perfect
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Might by another but I will actually need the charger in the box this time,5,I love this thing but there was no charger in the box. I luckily have one that is compatible but it didn’t come with one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker must buy,5,Speaker is fantastic great speaker but little tip don’t charge with a charger other than the one that is giving with the speaker because it will ruin the battery other than that it’s the best purchase I have ever made highly recommended
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ended up ordering two of the flip 4 which are pretty much water resistant,5,"I have the flip3 model but you cannot sync it fir stereo sound with the flip4. Ended up ordering two of the flip 4 which are pretty much water resistant, more so than the flip3. Loving the sound that comes out of these and I love the cord attached to it so I can hand it anywhere. I can hear the music even over the jets on my hot tub. Blown away as to how loud they can go, I'm sure my one and only neighbor is ready to kill me lol."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good but could be louder,4,Good speaker! Hoping it was a little louder but still great! The size of the speaker limits the range of the sound but that’s as expected.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Ease of use.,5,Simplicity!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,This is a great speaker! It has the best sound of any I have purchased before.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4??,5,The sound from these little speakers is great. I have 2 and link them so I can fill my area with sound or go from room to room without having to blast my ears. And some time I crank them up because I can.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,I love everything about this speaker. I'm extremely happy with it.  I do recommend it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Value,5,Portability of a quality music source
"JBL Flip 4, Black",4 Stars,4,I ordered it because it was water proof and my intentions was to use it by the poolside and I am very happy with the purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound so so connection to each other,4,Great sound and lasted for hours before needing a recharge. Ended up buying 2 more for the connectivity between them.Only giving a 4 star review because sometimes the connection between them cuts in and out. Otherwise works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,Sound is absolutely amazing. Feels like surround sound. I Bluetooth it to my tv and my movies sound awesome!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful little speaker!,5,A powerful little speaker that add nice music to any setting
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker to have,5,"I love it! Great sound quality out of a little tiny device. The battery lasts several hours so for sure to last your party for the night. Apparently you can link 2 or more of these speakers together via the JBL app but that app has bad reviews and people say it doesnt work... So not sure about that. But as far as this little speaker goes, it is great for your money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,Love this speaker!  Definitely recommend - fantastic sound and I love the color!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very pleased with first set of speakers,5,"Given the battery life a 4 star as cannot give comprehensive review; so, charged 3 days ago on receipt of the speakers and still going strong with  2-3 hours play per day.I read reviews of the JBL3 vs JBL 4 and have sampled the sound quality on the 3. The 3 is strong on bass as compared to the 4. Having sampled both speakers on the sound quality I prefer the 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My favorite!,5,Sounds Great! Love that I can pair it with my other flip 4 in party or stereo mode.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",very good quality in sound,5,"So far so good, we bought this speaker to listen to music while we are at beach, hotels etc and so far it's been really good"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best one I've had!,5,"I love it!  I used to have a portable Bluetooth speaker and it died.  I saw a close friend had this.. and it got really loud, really quickly..and still had a pristine sound.  I didn't think about it at the time, but when mine died, I asked him about it.. and he suggested I get it.  I absolutely love mine.  Easily transportable, waterproof - which is great because I'm constantly near the water, and the sound is unbeatable.  Great purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!,5,Didn’t charge it for 2 days and it still had about 3 to 4 dots still flashing. Good battery life! Sound is excellent.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Portable, good sound and so easy to use - is a win!",5,"Portable, good sound and so easy to use - is a win!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great,5,My husband loves it uses it every day
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Portable,  lightweight and GREAT sound!",5,"GREAT SOUND in a small speaker.  These speakers were purchased for my husband for our anniversary.  We love having the ability to take them and use them wherever we go!Portable, light and fantastic sound !  Great for in or outdoors ! We are going to buy 4 more to use through the house all can be connected at once !  Keep them charged up .... you will use them ALL the time!!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the price!,5,"Great sound quality, and insane battery life.  It may seem a little pricey,  but I don't regret the splurge..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stereo mode doesn't work,3,"At first I bought one Flip 4 and I was impressed with the sound quality. Seeing the stereo option available with two Flip 4's, I decided to buy a second Flip 4. Big mistake. Sound constantly cuts in and out. There is a multiple second long delay before sound starts playing. The Bluetooth connected speaker only plays sound about 60% of the time. Lots of static noise. Very disappoint."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and fantastic price,5,I have been enjoying this for weeks. Didn’t bother with the newest generation after reading reviews. Will purchase a second for pairing soon!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Purchase!,5,Excellent sound and quality. Great bass!! Love this and it was easy to connect to my phone
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,"The first speaker didn't charge correctly, returned it second one has been great. Sounds good couples easily."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speakers shut themselves off!,3,"The sound quality is good, and I have had no problems with the mic cutting out on Zoom calls. HOWEVER, the entire thing will shut itself off. No warning, just disconnects. This is not useful in the middle of a webinar or longer call! While it helps to keep the unit plugged in (I can get 45 to an hour), it does not totally solve the problem. The result is that I must stop the webinar I am leading and reconnect which makes me look rather incompetent."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great choice,5,Love it! Got this for my mother and she loved it. Now i want to buy one for myself!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love,5,I use this all the time and absolutely love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Speaker,5,We bought this speaker to take with us on golf cart rides and also to put out on our deck. Sound quality is excellent and was easy to set up. Very pleased with the speaker and the quick shipment from seller.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,Amazing product. The quality of the speakers is awesome. The sound is so good. 100% recommended ????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life not long enough.,3,Battery life at full volume is about 2 and half hours. It says 10 hours battery life but I'm sure that it at minimal volume. I was expecting more. Over all it sounds great.  And make sure you have it on a surface that has room because it will vibrant off from the bass.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great battery life,5,"Maybe I haven't used it long enough, straight playing, but the battery life far exceeds any time I need.  Doesn't get even half way down after 4hr's of very loud music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"Awesome sound! Great price!JBL makes a good product for a reasonable price. I had a really great speaker made by HK. It was about $300 and I had it for about 6 years. I was heartbroken when it died.For less than a third of the price, you really can’t find a better sounding speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LEGIT AF,5,"It’s louder than I expected. Sounds good. It’s a little pricey, but worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent gift to anyone,5,Black one for my daughter and I bought the second on for my sister. She use it in her office and also in her car too. She loves her speaker. Excellent gift ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,This is the second JBL Flip speaker that I have purchased. I bought one for myself and one as a gift. We both like them.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,I love this speaker! Good sound quality and fair price! I play saxophone and it helps rre practice with background music !!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth Speaker,5,Love this bluetooth speaker. I have 3 of them. The sound is amazing and the battery life is good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this! Perfect gift!,5,Nothing to dislike. Love having it at the beach . The sound quality is superb!Bluetooth connection easy .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",That jawn BOOMIN,5,"I love the sound quality, it really booms for its size, and the battery life is very long! I love this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Build quality is Great, audio not so impressive",2,"I wanted to use this speaker so bad. When you feel the weight of the box, open it up and pull out this JBL Speaker, you know you are handling some high quality workman ship. The buttons give immediate feedback. You can just feel this baby in your hands, and you just want to turn it up and start beating to your tunes.......and that is where it kinda starts to make ya turn your head.I actually was able to give it a side by side sound test. The other Bluetooth speaker was of a lesser quality, a cheaper built. It's speaker where a bit larger. Not huge, but larger. It sounded way way better. I will be listening to that instead of this unbelievably build JBL 4 Flip.This is the speaker that sounded better:50W(70W Peak) Wireless Bluetooth Speakers Built-in 8000mAh Battery Power Bank, W-KING Outdoor Portable Waterproof TWS, DSP, NFC Speaker, Powerful Rich Bass Loud Stereo Sound"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid apeaker,5,Good sound and projects well. No matter how good more battery life would be nice. All around much better than those of comparable price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,The speaker has been left  outside in the rain a few times and still sounds great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great product,5,love this speaker. so durable and holds a charge. you can even link it with another speaker (same brand) and have multiple speakers playing together. highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,I love playing music on this baby here. The sound quality is amazing!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!,5,This speaker is awesome!  The sound is amazing and the battery life makes it easy to listen all day.  Highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You will be pleased can’t promise fully satisfied though.,4,"I can’t justify a five star rating because I personally don’t love this speaker no real reason why not. It is very good, it just doesn’t blow me away. I’m using it right now writing the review and the only possible negative I have is that I didn’t test out more speakers. This one is a great value, for $70-80 range this is an awesome speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Packaging & Quality,5,"Use these (pair of Flip 4's) with my Samsung Tab A 2019 tablet.Mp4 music video's & Mp3's & movies. I love these.Like always w/JBL's incredibly good packaging!!!! I seem too get 6-8hrs out of a charge, but I listen at higher volumes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Little package, big sound",5,"Love it! So small but packs a lot of power, haven't turned the full volume up yet because I haven't needed to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small but loud!,5,"Small but loud, the battery last extremely long I'm surprised with my speaker. Have not regret to have bought it. The sound is good no bass distortion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good bang for your buck,4,wish battery last a little longer
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Granddaughter was thrilled!,5,This bluetooth speaker offers an excellent sound.  Being waterproof is an added feature and the size and appearance makes it look expensive.Our 12 year old granddaughter was truly pleased with this gift and thankful to receive it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"I use this speaker in the shower, watching movies on my computer and listening to music.  It has very good sound quality and a long battery life.  The Bluetooth is easy to connect.  It’s not very heavy so it’s easy to carry and very portable.  It’s easy to charge on the computer and charges quickly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,My favorite speaker - my friends fight over who gets to connect to play dj - great sound for the size
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best speaker,5,I love the loud sound it’s what a wanted!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,4,seems to be a good deal for the cost.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,We used this for our wedding.  Music was played from the computer and the JPL was on the other side of the yard.  Was heard very well.  Was very pleased.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound from such a small device.,5,I would absolutely recommend this to anybody looking for a rugged great sounding speaker. We use it on our small boat all the time instead of installing a stereo and it works fantastic.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",best purchase ever,5,I am so happy I bought this ! great sound quality . The price isn't too bad for what you get. Good battery life . Light weight and easy to carry . Cute . Love it ! Thinking of buying my dad one for fathers day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for a little speaker,5,This is a powerful speaker with the best sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Plays in my boat all day.,5,Perfect speaker for out on the boat. The battery lasts all day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!,4,"Great, rugged little portable speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid clean sounding balanced performer.,5,"Solid performer for its size.  Bought for my 2 kids to use indoor/ outdoor.  Nice overall clean & balanced sound while able to deliver good bass.  Will test Bluetooth range in the summer.  Having listened to Paradigm, Klipsch speakers in the house for over 20yrs, this Flip4 is pretty comparable in delivering clean sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Louder Than You Think,5,This speaker is small but incredibly mighty. It is waterproof (i spilled something on it) and durable so far!The sound is high quality and at roughly 50% can be heard in my whole apartment. The controls on the speaker make it better than some other options for bluetooth speakers available. 5 stars - would definitely recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!!,5,"So glad I purchased this.  The battery life is awesome, but even better is the sound that comes out of this thing.  I need to get another one so that I can sync them in tandem and have stereo sound while in a hotel room or out on the back patio.  Amazing!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than expected,5,"Sound quality is very good considering the size of this speaker. The amount time between recharge is extremely good. I seldom  have the volume turned up to maximum and it easily plays sixteen hours. It also recharges very quickly.  Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The only thing I didn't like is the ends don't have much protection, in fact the instructions tell you not to touch or push on the ends. That's a small trade off for the sound quality and not a deal breaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it,5,I needed a speaker for my loud music lol it’s perfect
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,"This little speaker packs a punch. It’s portable, easy to connect and does a better job than most other speakers. If in doubt, try it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Much better sound than listening from my iPad alone.,5,Works great; connectivity took longer than I thought it would - but sound quality is great.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"The Connect+ feature has only worked with other Flip 4's in my experience (Didn't work with the 3 or 5) but other than that, I love it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound is incredible,5,I liked that I could pick the color that I want and it’s just loud enough to feel the music but not to loud to where it will seep through the walls
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What the fart?!,3,"I've had my Flip 4 since 2017, so it is three years old. But for the last year or so, I've had to keep the speaker plugged in all the time or the battery dies. Recently it's at the point that it dies even when it is plugged in, and I know it's dying when it starts to make an awful squeaky farty sound. I've taken great care of this speaker- it has spent most of its life on a shelf. I would like it to have lasted more than two-ish years."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker for Great Price,5,"I've really enjoyed my JBL Flip 4. The sound quality is the best for the size speaker you get. JBL doesn't sacrafice quality or integrity of the product. The Connect+ feature is also great, as it allows you to connect multiple speakers at once. Sometimes the quality of the sound when connected to multiple speakers is sacrificed, and for that reason I give it less than 5 stars."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing unit,5,"You can take this anywhere and get some of the greatest music. It has wonderful clarity, and sound quality. It is like being in a room with it. I love it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,It was a gift I gave to daughter and son in law. They haven’t dropped it in water yet but I’m sure it will happen. They love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get it!,5,"I’m really impressed with this speaker! I bought it because I couldn’t find my Bose Bluetooth speaker in my stupid storage unit... I looked and looked but gave up and forked over the cash for this speaker and I don’t regret it one bit! It sounds just as good as my Bose does... and if I ever find that sucker, I’ll acrually be able to test them back to back. Anyway, get this one ??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommended!,5,"For the price, best speaker on market. Took to the beach and no issues at all."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I lovei t sounds ??,5,The quality is great also the Bluetooth  no problem great very easy to hook it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality superior,5,Other members of my family brought this on a vacation....SOLD...purchased one right away
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this,5,I even use this in my car to listen to stuff on my phone because it is such good sound quality. I cannot attest to the waterproof capabilities.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The service was great !,5,I like that everything works and the delivery was fast and safe !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Most Overrated Brand in the market,1,"Poor volume, poor Bluetooth distance, is NOT waterproof, they do not stand behind their product. Not loud enough when outside. Cannot be more than 10 feet from it to stay connected. First one died when it got splashed with water. They replaced it under warranty. One year later the same  thing happed to the replacement speaker. They would not replace it because the replacement did not come a warranty. Only the original purchase has a warranty. Obviously they know they sell garbage so have a warranty policy to protect their bottom line.  Last JBL I’ll ever buy and any other product under their parent company Harman Audio/Harman International."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just as good as Bose Soundlink Mini II,5,GREAT SPEAKER! Can't beat the price.I also love that it has an AUX cable port which is really rare on bluetooth speakers these days.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Speakers,5,"The product is amazing, I've had it for a year now and my girlfriends had the older model for 2 years and there is no issues with them at all. The sound is great and the durability of the speakers is fantastic, it does tend to turn off every hour and a half which can get annoying but other than that I've had no issues at all."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,"Has a great, rich sound for such a small speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful speaker,5,It was everything that was said in the reviews. No problem Bluetooth it to my iPhone 11.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy!,5,The sound is very powerful for a small speaker. The battery is great and charges up pretty quickly. Definitely recommend it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Kickin compact,4,"Great compact unit! really good sound just lacks clarity, sounds a little muffled at times but well worth the money"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Consistent Quality & Great Battery,5,"I’ve had this for like a year, and it has never failed me. Definitely a purchase I’m happy I made."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy buena compra!,5,Una compra mas en amzon en la cual quedo muy agusto y feliz
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great!,5,Love my Flip!  Sounds great. I love the color. And oh so portable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Flip 4 JBL,5,"Great product. Has great sound and works fine with my tv, laptop and cell phone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend,5,Great sound quality even at high volumes. It plays loud enough to where I can still hear my podcasts in a very noisy dog grooming salon. Love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Great speakers. I ordered 2 and had no problem connecting them, sometimes due to 'distance/proximity' between them there is interference but once you find your sweet spot, they work like a charm."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy with this JBL speaker. We would buy again.,5,We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She loves our and uses it to listen to her music all the time. It was very worth the money and I would buy it again for myself or as another gift. We also have the JBL clip and we love that speaker as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not only does this speaker sound MUCH better than any other bluetooth speaker I've used before,5,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was so blown away by the clear sound of this JBL Flip 4 speaker that I had to rate it 5 stars.  Not only does this speaker sound MUCH better than any other bluetooth speaker I've used before, it also is MUCH louder.  I couldn't believe how loud this speaker could get, while maintaining a full, clear sound.  I'm thinking of buying another speaker to put in a different part of my house.  Very impressed with this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What's better for a Christmas Golf Cart Parade,5,"Did my best to cheer everyone up this Christmas and this sound was deep, clear and wonderful.  Even used it on driveway on New Year's Eve."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality for such a small speaker,5,"I use this for going to the beach, hiking, or hanging out at the pool and its plenty loud for all of those activities, and you don;t have to crank it to the point of distorting either. If you have the volume on your device and on the speaker all the way up, you will hear some distortions but there aren't many scenarios where that is necessary."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",this speaker is awesome and loud,5,"this speaker is awesome and loud! I got this for a few reasons, i drive locally in some older tractor trailers and there isnt any radios in most of our trucks so this is handy playing music from my phone also gonna zip tie it to the front of my can-am and jam while ill ride. i got the camo and the pattern is amazing. it also will connect to other speakers. i would recommend and would purchase again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perf,5,Fits perfectly in my backpack nice sound and volume
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,I use this mostly when going to the pool. It has quality sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loved so much I bought this second one,5,"Bought ine for my daughter, liked it so much bought one foe me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product at a great price.,5,Purchased this for my wife to play worship music and she loves it. I gave it a four star rating on battery life because I’ve not had it long enough to truly review the life of the battery. I will add that the previous JBL’s we’ve Owen have had great battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jbl flip 4,5,"Sounds good, battery last a long time when playing.Pairs to phone extremely easy"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Compact with a punch.,5,"Bought this for my dad after his JBL Flip 2 finally wore out. He uses this every single day, all day long. The quality has increased since the original design and the sound is great. Not gonna blow your ear drums out and doesn't have ridiculous bass but it is plenty loud and sounds great. Battery life seems great so far and I know if I have any problems Harmon international ""JBL"" will stand behind their product. I would and will buy JBL products again when the time comes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My second JBL ! It’s a little smaller but equal in sound !,5,"Like all features of my JBL especially sound quality, battery life ! it’s my beach buddy!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend! Perfect pool speaker!,5,I love this little speaker! I bought it to take to the pool and it’s perfect for that. Loud enough for me to enjoy but not so loud that it disturbs others that don’t like my music. Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound,5,Great sound and bass for a small speaker. Connecting is easy. I take it everywhere highly recommended
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent quality of sound,5,Just love everything about this speaker!  The sound quality is excellent & convenient to use
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super great bass,5,This speaker covers it all. Absolutely a super fine speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black","The speaker is worth it, great sound",5,"The phone battery last for a while, it’s an amazing speaker, if you want good sound. If you get more of these, you can connect them all and the music will be even louder. I had an issue with my speaker couple months after I got it, it would not charge at all with any cord! I’m exchanging it right now with the JBL website, but the speaker is so worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good speaker, not for noisy work areas",4,I work in a factory with numerous machines roaming back and forth and we must wear hearing protection. Our work radios are all dying so I bought this. It is not loud enough to be heard with hearing protection and the noise of the machines about 7 feet away. The battery also died in 3.5 hours on max volume.Its good for quieter areas though. Solidly Built and good quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,Really enjoying this great little speaker! Battery life is good and it puts out more sound than one would expect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound! Quality product!,5,It’s freakin fabulous! Beyond my expectations! Such quality sound from such a small speaker! I love it. Best Amazon purchase ever!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The volume is not as loud as I though,5,"I like it, portable and waterproof - great for the beach"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound and Light Weight- Perfect!,5,"I use this Bluetooth speaker all the time. It’s great for teaching because I can throw it in my purse, it’s that small. I also own the Charge 3, and although the sound is a bit louder, it doesn’t have the same clarity or ease of portability. My Flip 4 was stolen and I ordered another one with in a week. I love this speaker, you will too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 is awesome…,5,This is the second Flip 4 for me…have a black one also…great sound and can pair together…
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Speaker,5,"This little speaker has great sound.  I use it on my golf cart, back yard, inside house.  It may seem pricy, but it is not, when you get something that is better than expected."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than Bose because I’m not afraid to take it outside.,5,"I’m very happy with this little speaker. If money was no object then I probably would have gotten a Bose, which would have been a mistake. Bose is great, but for a fraction of the price this JBL has great sound with surprisingly good bass. And the fact that it costs a lot less makes me less afraid to take it to the beach or park or camping; I don’t think I’d do that with a $300+ Bose speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud and easy to connect to Bluetooth,5,Great product. It’s very loud. I was not expecting the volume to be loud and clear. My son loves it. It was easy to connect to Bluetooth as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stopped holding a charge,1,I have had this for a few years and it no longer holds a charge. I can't use it unless it is plugged in and even then it will randomly shut off. Great sound but so disappointed in how it functions now.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Don't waste your money on cheaper alternatives as I did. They just went back. This speaker has great sound quality, including the bass. I struggled with it connecting a few times but it may have been my wifi.  My son has the charge 3 and he keeps stealing mine. The charge 3, which we always thought had excellent sound, now sounds muddled compared to this. Great purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Dont drop it!,4,"I love this speaker AWESOME sound.Just 1 warning, DO NOT DROP THIS Speaker.I dropped mine from the top of my bedroom dresser drawer and it broke. I took it to a local electronics repair shop and it cost me $25 to fix. Other than that great speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound delivery but irritating system sounds,4,This speaker provides excellent sound for its size and I would give it 5 stars but for the really irritating sounds it makes when turned on or off and activating Bluetooth pairing. They are quite loud and obnoxious and can't be muted or even quieted; I can't imagine what their development team was thinking (there are numerous complaints on JBL's own support site about it).
"JBL Flip 4, Black",She loved it!,5,"Got this speaker for my mom as a Christmas gift. She loved it!!!. This small speaker puts an incredible amount of sound and clarity. For the price you cant go wrong. Its a well know brand, and it looks sleek with any home/office decor.  The quality is as expected, per JBL standards. It feels nice and solid , good enough for the outdoors.  This speaker would make a great add on for a garage especially when you're working on a project.A+++"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Music,5,WIsh battery lasted longer but works great on the beach
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty good,5,"The battery runs out a little fast; maybe I'm expecting too much especially because I play it for hours at a time. Either way, it's a good purchase. If you're trying to choose between this and another, I've heard that the bass is better on this than others as far as a portable speaker. From my experience, it seems to live up to that."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Im very happy with the speaker though  it did not completely work for my intended purpose it works and sounds fantastic
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Missing charger,4,Great product mine just didn’t come with a charger.  Luckily I had one that fit at home however thought it would include one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,I have a UE Boom as well and this speaker sounds better and is easier to pair.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great blue tooth speaker,5,"The sound is great, it follows me everywhere, love it, battery life is very long!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is good,4,you can't adjust treble and base
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works for me!,5,Right out of the box it worked well. Sound is good and clear. Don’t know about battery longevity bc I just opened it. Thought it would be larger but sound is what I’m looking for. Sounds better than Sony s version.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good soeaker,3,Bought one and it fell into our hot tub. Didn’t work after that even though it’s advised as water proof. Got a new one and it works great but I’ll keep it away from the hot tub.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,This speaker is amazing!I use it by our hot tubIt connects immediately to Bluetooth
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a awsome radio very clear and loud,5,I cant it was a gift its wrapped
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love my speaker!,5,This is a great speaker! Battery lasts for a long time and is so easy to connect and start.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Outstanding overall, battery could be better.",3,"The build quality, sound quality, and volume are all outstanding at this price point. However, I have two issues that potential customers should be aware of:1) The Bluetooth connection is not password protected. Essentially, this allows any device within range to connect.2) At full volume, the battery life is lackluster at best. I got about 4 hours of use at full volume.My primary use for this device is to play music during the work day. I work in the Building Trades. My work environments are loud. This speaker provides enough volume to compete with the noise. But, the battery life suffers and it'll only last half the day before needing a charge.That being said, if you're looking for an affordable, quality, portable speaker to drag around, this is a fine choice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,"Great sound quality, truly water proof! Charge lasts awhile"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very pleased,5,Very pleased
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It doesn't have USB-C port, but it has micro USB port.",4,It is best sound quality and bettery life for small portable speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker could be louder for the price.,4,Nice little speaker. I expected the volume would be a little louder for the price. However the quality of sound is good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Product, Great Sound",5,When it arrived and I unpackaged it and saw the box that this is a high quality product. My husband is a sound man and he's the one who suggested this when I said I wanted a portable sound machine. I recommend it to anyone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds sweet,5,"This little thing sounds grate, perfect for the pool or the beach or something out door or in a room"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound worth it!,5,You have to download the app to connect to the Bluetooth but other than that it’s great. It was recommended by a friend and I bought it as a gift for my Comadre. She said it sound like she has a whole music system in her apt.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,So far loving this but only used for about 2 weeks. Will update if anything changes.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality at a great price,5,Love the JBL Flip 4 speakers — great quality sound at a decent price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use,5,This was a surprise Christmas gift from my husband who knows how much I love audiobooks. I listen to them while I’m cleaning and was pleasantly surprised to learn that phone calls also come through clearly. It is easy to set up and use and the battery has a good lifespan.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",hmm,5,"sound quality is really good, but battery is not in a good condition rn,"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, super light",5,"The sound from this small speaker is really great- good highs and lows. It's cool that you can pair several of them together to play the same audio- my friend bought one of his own and we can use them together when we hang out.  Waterproofing seems effective, haven't had any issues using this near the pool where it has gotten some water drops splashed on it.  Can't beat it at the price point."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",El producto que sea de buena calidad,4,Me agrado el producto
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,Great sound. Like to play my music on my patio to enjoy the vibes wirh the family.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Definitely One of the Best Purchases Ever,5,"I bought it 2 months ago and I use it almost everyday. It's totally loud enough for parties but quiet enough for when you want to sleep with music playing. Also useful for showers because it's waterproof. Its bass is amazing, as well as sound quality. The size is perfect to fit in any bag and even to carry it in your hand (because it has a tiny strap connected to it)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not extremely loud but good,4,"It's loud sure but not loud enough. Its only good for the quality sound of the speaker, not for the loudest but still pretty good. A midget speaker for 23 dollars on Amazon was louder. I like how it is waterproof. I also like how it has a good base. Feels high quality too. Battery life is long."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,I love this speaker so much it is all around amazing sound quality. The base is BOOMIN and if you put it vertically you can hear it even louder. I love it so much!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy it,5,Took a risk not even hearing it before buying it. Sounds great and very loud. Feels like it is built very durable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good but not fantastic,4,"Sound is pretty good, bass could be better, heavy metal songs dont sound as good. Seems to be a hip hop/rap speaker more than a universal. Volume isnt too bad for size, and battery life isnt as good as advertised. Even if i listen to just podcasts the battery life will last about 9 hours straight before needing a charge"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever!!,5,"Love,Love,Love it!! The best Bluetooth speaker I have owned I would buy it a gazillion times over! The sound quality is unmatched hands down!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,"My husband just loves it ! For laying by the pool, and when we ride our bikes to the beach."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound!,5,"Love this speaker so much, I even bought another to use upstairs or when I want stereo sound downstairs.  It's compact, yet the sound quality is really very good and the battery life is great so far.  We're very pleased with this product and use it almost every day."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cómprela no se va a repentir...,4,"Me gusto mucho, es pequeña pero tiene una potencia increíble, lo único que no me gusto es que le batería se termina muy rápido... recomendable al 100..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So good i bought 2.,5,"I really love this speaker.The sound quality is wonderful, deep base and incredible Bluetooth range.I like it so much I purchased a second for a gift to my brother."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is amazing.,5,This bluetooth speaker is amazing and  has powerful sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker - Placement is important for good sound,3,I love the form factor and sound in most situations.  Some places it sounds great others it sounds marginal.  Placement is important for good sound.  I bring this to hotel rooms when I travel and it works great in that situation.  In a very open outdoor space it is a little less full sounding.  The battery lasts for several hours when it is working properly.  I purchased one a few months before this one and wanted another because I like it so much.  Now just after one year (the warranty period) it shuts down at random and has static sounds when playing.  JBL offered to send a replacement if this one is really defective!  Let's see how this works out.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality sounding speaker.,5,This is a great sounding speaker. JBL has always been one of my favorite brands. Don't hesitate to buy this !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm pleased with this Flip 4,5,"Easy to use, good sound quality (I'm not a perfectionist or sound engineer) but for my listening pleasure, I'm happy.I use it for my audio books, music and occasionally for conference calling."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",works well,5,"Used it numerous times.  Great quality and looks sharp.  No issues to report.  Sound is great, I bought a carabiner to attach to the rope so I could attach it to things while I wanted to listen to music (the bimini of my boat).  Was easy to pair with my phone, is well made and I am guessing I will get years o use out of this tool.u"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",La amo.,5,"Es muy portátil, no molesta en lo absoluto en mi mochila.Para ser tan pequeña tiene muy buen sonido y muy buen bass.Vale mucho la pena."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cannot Recommend Enough!!!,5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE! This is the third JBL speaker I've bought, and I've had a few other brands as well, Flip 4 blows them out of the water! Including the Flip 3. Fabulous volume, deep sound. Every other speaker I've owned sounds muffled and flat, definitely not so with this one. I have it at half volume right now, and the music is rich and full, at max volume it's more than enough to irritate your neighbors.I hardly ever write reviews, but this speaker is so far beyond expectations that I had to."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good things come in small packages,5,It's a great sound system that you can bring along anywhere :)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great product for the price,5,"I looked around a lot for a speaker in this price range and was nervous to get any of them, but so far this has performed really well. The sound quality is clear, the bass is great, and its pretty decently loud. When underwater, the speaker stops playing - the waterproof function seems like more of a protective feature in case of dropping it in the water."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for the beach.,5,The sound was excellent sound like stereo sound system.  Connected easy with Bluetooth.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's as good as it looks! Great value. Go for it.,5,It's extremely well constructed. Looks good. Long battery life. Great for a small apt in an urban setting.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Sound for a portable Speaker,5,As expected from JBL sound is awesome on this product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for using in cars with poor stereos!,5,Love this thing! I got it for my winter car which is an older Awd wagon and lacking a decent stereo. Fits perfectly in my cupholder and sounds great! Actually has really nice bass tones too! I love the portability of it and that I can take it out on my kayak or other outdoor activities this summer!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker is amazing!!,5,"After searching for quite some time, my husband and I purchased this speaker as a Christmas gift for ourselves and it so glad we did!  The sound quality is incredibly clear!  We played the speaker for about 10 hours one day and then used it just about every day for about an hour a day and the battery lasted 8 days before completely dying.  Highly recommend and would definitely buy from this brand."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW!!!!,5,"I have a beats pill, and have had it for over 8 years. It still works, but when compared to this JbL...my oh my the sound from the JBL is 100x better!!!! Great price too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value and sound,5,"This is a great product, sound is awesome! Easy to figure out, lightweight and perfect to use outside and in."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",real nice sound,4,"like the sound ,size and fast connect to my phone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,I love this speaker it's amazing!! It gets loud and battery last for a while
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this thing.,5,"This thing rocks, we use it while in the shower, cooking , and just about everything thing.  It sounds amazing and the battery life is no so bad. For some reason the Bluetooth cuts off once in awhile.  But it is worth every penny. My oldest child wants on for her room."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I like it,4,I like it !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super,5,Like it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery and sound quality are amazing,5,Sound quality is great with this portable speaker. Connected to my phone and iPad with zero problems. I’ve had a couple of other brands that will be stubborn about connecting. Plus I just love the fun teal color.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love my purchase,5,I love my speaker. Great sound and I got a great deal on it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Portability with high quality sound,5,"Bought this JBL for when I golf, go to the beach, sit in the back deck.....basically any chance I get I use it.Love the color options, chose mine because haven’t seen many of them around."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",As represented,5,"So far, it has performed as represented. Remember to register it for the warranty coverage."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing little speaker!,5,"This was the best birthday gift ever and the color is my favorite! I feel like I rarely have to charge it for as often as I use it but then when I do, it doesn't take too long. The sound is very loud and clear, pretty impressive for such a small speaker. As long as you don't submerge it in water, it's totally waterproof and I've had 0 issues."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",La mejor bocina que he tenido en mi vida.,5,Llevo varios años con esta bocina y me parece excelente.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound quality,5,Great sound quality! I'll probably buy another one so we can have 2 outside during summer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the speaker for what it is.,4,So just recently reserved the speaker and the first thing I could tell was how good the build quality was. Now going back to write this reword 2 days later after making the purchase I saw it was in sale and was almost $30 cheaper than when I bought it. So a little disappointed that I missed these. But over all a great speaker with wonderful highs and lows and a great bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Se daño a los 2 meses…,5,Solo funciono 2 meses.  No lo recomiendo
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I really wanted to like this speaker.,3,"I really wanted to like this speaker.  I just couldn't get over the lack of bass.  I went back and forth between this and the Bose Soundlink Color 2.  I decided to try the JBL because it has all the same features plus it is waterproof, fits in a cup holder and is cheaper.  Other reviews addressed the lack of bass and they are right.  I thought maybe they were overly critical but they were not.  The lack of low end becomes glaringly apparent at higher volumes.  You can hear it drop out as you turn it up.  Besides the lack of bass, it seemed to have good sound and great overall construction.  However, the sound was enough of an issue for me to return it and get the BOSE, which I am very happy with."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good for close listening.,4,"I wish it could have a little bit more Bass, it could be a little louder and I wish it would charge a little quicker. Other than that for close listening it works fine."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's a JBL. It works great,5,"Works great. Sound quality, size, sturdiness and battery life is great. It's a JBL I don't expect anything less"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for camping!!,5,Lasted all weekend long without a charge! Great quality sound and easy to connect to.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Practical and great quality!,5,"The sound is amazing for the size, it's super easy to connect to blue tooth and I love that it's waterproof!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very satisfied with this little speaker,4,"I like the sound, volume, very portable, listen to music around the house."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Timeless Quality Speaker,5,Great speaker!! The price is great and it doesn’t matter if it’s an older version because it’s still really good quality!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Produces good sound through the speaker.,5,"The JBL Flip4 bluetooth speaker is a nice speaker to use, and I was able without much fuss pair it with my ipod touch.  The sound came through well via both ends and if you touch it either end while blasting some tunes, you'll feel it vibrating.  It's a nice size to hold in your hand, and you can easily put it around your wrist if so desired."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Circle of Life,5,You can easily leave this on in your house and blast “The Circle of Life” on full volume from your car and watch your spouse jump three feet into the air through the window.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is good,4,"I had to request a replacement because my first order it would keep dying all the time. The replacement works fine, I guess the first one had a faulty battery but overall I am happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great for price,5,"So far so great, always wanted something like this always bought cheaper ones and let me tell you. Sound quality is better than my first car(yes it had speakers), connected easily to both apple and droids. Used mainly in shop and while doing yard work.....want another to link and have a great soundsystem for relatively cheap"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing unless you plan on getting it wet often!,3,"This speaker is honestly great! My only complaint is the water proof ness. It seems as if every time I get the speaker wet, water condensates underneath the main power button. Of course, it always goes away and has no effect on the speaker. Other than that I love :)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great waterproof Bluetooth speaker with clear sound.,5,Great connectivity with Bluetooth source.  I carry it on my boat.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The stereo sound on two 4's together is fantastic. Better than a older Bose speaker we have,4,"This is our third flip we have purchased (one 3 and two 4's). The sound on these are incredible. I wish the 3's and 4's were compatible, but I knew that when I bought them. The stereo sound on two 4's together is fantastic. Better than a older Bose speaker we have. I hope all my neighbors buy these so we can amp-up any party with connecting sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great quality of sound for small size. May buy some more as they link to other units.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Purchase,5,"The sound quality is amazing, very light to carry around. Overall this was a great purchase."

I bought for my teenage son and he loves it.The sound is very good and the connectivity is excellent with apple products (can’t speak for Android).We’ve had this items for two months so durability and life battery is still to be determined.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","A high quality, reliable speaker",5,"Fantastic sound, with a cute and portable design! Bluetooth connectivity seems to be pretty reliable, and the battery life is more than enough."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome! Except...,5,"Really good sound and bass. Battery life is so long I forget the last time I charged it, or maybe my memory sucks. The only complaint I have is anyone can just kick off your Bluetooth connection and play what they want. This is fine until you're in your barracks latrine and some jack ass starts playing extremely loud moaning sounds"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My flip 4 does not pair well with my JBL Boom Box. To much interferance occures.,5,"I know that this is a matter of taste, but I have always preferred the sound JBL speakers have over any other speakers I've listened to. This JBL product does not disappoint."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm Impressed!,5,My last outdoor Bluetooth speaker bit the dust. My search for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that was conducive for outdoor use began. I read the reviews of many speakers including Bose. Decided on the JBL Flip 4. Fast shipment and it was packaged well. Easy to pair with my IPhone. But the best part was the quality of sound. This little speaker packs a punch. I'm so very pleased with my decision to purchase the Flip 4. Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Nice sound, good value",5,"The JBL Flip 4 has great sound and works extremely well for the price. I like the ability to link several of them together. The JBL app for Android is pretty clunky, but not the worst I've seen. Good value sound. Spend more money if you need good bass response, though. That's my only quibble."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Use this everyday,4,"Got this speaker originally to use at work, but I bring it everywhere with me now! We have property on a lake and this comes to the lake with us every weekend. We use it on the boat, at camp, at home and at work. A very versatile and handy speaker!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Exceeded expectations, makes you look for a hidden sub in the room.",5,"These speakers, not only sounded fantastic, but also exceeded my expectations.  Both my boys were approving of the gift.  I got a thumbs up from one of them at least.  I'm now thinking of getting one for myself if I can think of a use for them besides the obvious.  I already have good tunes everywhere I go.  Maybe I need to go more places."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",this speakers lags when listening to youtube,3,This is a heartbreaker. I mean its a stunning speaking on the look. It sounds really great (even tho maybe a bit too bassy). But the audio lags when listening to youtube or movies. I mean....COME ON. I am so sad but this is some sort of deal breaker for me. :/
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s a great asset for the hard of hearing people.,5,My husband is hard of hearing & it helps him to be able to hear. This is the second one we’ve owned.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker.,5,Sound quality is great. Easy to carry around.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great small speaker,5,They have larger models with better sound quality or sound range but for the price this is a great speaker for your apartment or to listen to within 30 feet. It's definitely loud enough for how portable it is.The waterproof functionality is great. I took this on a floating trip where it was fully submerged several times and still worked the same.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Great sound, battery life could be better but will last for a day at the beach or pool. I use it in my workshop and Bluetooth connection to my phone is great."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for size,5,bought this on sale for about $60 and had it the next day. Sound quality is great for the size. Bass is not crazy but not lacking.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",DONT GET SILVER- AWESOME SPEAKER THOUGH!,5,"I love it, I get compliments on the sound quality every time I've used it around people. Battery lasts a decent amount of time. Bluetooth hookup was easy easy. The only downside at all is that the silver color gets so dirty so easily and kind of looks terrible. I think I'm going to have to order another one just because it looks kind of gross after it fell in the dirt while camping."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE JBL,5,"I cannot speak highly enough about this speaker! First of all, the color is gorgeous and comes in many others of course. The sound is amazing and definitely projects out which is great for parties. It was super easy to connect to my phone and the battery life stays pretty long as well!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I would take a bullet for this Bluetooth speaker,5,Enough said.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Great speaker, especially for the price. Easy to setup and charge. For the size speaker the sound is great. I like the size too. Not too small, not to large. Compared to our sound bar speaker (which is much larger and has a subwoofer) the sound is a bit lacking but that’s to be expected."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound,5,I love how clear it sounds going to buy another for surround sound I needed it for camping but liked it so well I'm getting another feels good and plugs up to my battery packs so it never dies all day last a long time that way  for me  charge the speaker and battery your good. Nothing bad I can find with it no home theater but for a small speaker it holds It's own.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for little one,5,"Bought this for my wife, she is happy with it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Does not last 12 hours,4,Description said the battery would last 12 hours. I’ve only gotten about 7 hours of play. A bit disappointing.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Much improved over First Generation,5,Needed to replace our first generation speaker due to battery not being able to hold a charge and replacement was difficult. The Flip 4 has better sound quality and the battery lasts much longer than the first generation speaker. But alas it will still be difficult to replace the battery when the time comes......
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable speaker!,5,"I waited a few weeks to purchase this speaker instead of the Flip 3 for essentially the same price.  The Flip 4 sounds great!  The speaker is IPX7 water resistant.  I have not tested that feature out, but it is nice to know my speaker should be able to brush off a light rain shower, or an accidental spill.  I have not used this enough to test the battery length, but it is rated for 12 hours of use before require a recharge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Easy to carry, great for outside. Love it! Rivals my Bose…that was much more expensive!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Battery Life,5,The best part about this speaker is the incredible sound quality and battery life. I would use it for a week straight and it would still almost have a full battery. This speaker hands down the best on the market.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not Waterproof!! terrible sound.,2,I had a jbl speaker for soo long before this speaker. The sound quality was great. Then the battery started to fail after about 2 years. This one I had for about two months before the sounds quality started sounding like crap. I'm not sure because it had gotten a little wet but it sounds absolutely terrible now. Sounds blown out and I don't typically play it at the loudest setting. My phone speaker sounds better at this point.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better Than Advertised,5,This little speaker gives me 12-18 hours of continuous play depending on the volume setting. It charges much better through my computer than a wall outlet. The sound is amazingly crisp and clear for such a small speaker. I have given these speakers as gifts to my favorite family members. I recommend any music enthusiast that loves to be outdoors add this to their list of must haves.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Bluetooth speaker,5,I have purchased many Bluetooth speakers and JBL is leaps and bounds above the rest.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes. Buy them.,5,These speakers are awesome. The sound is loud and clear. You can create a whole home surround sound out of these if you desire.  I purchased two after almost buying Bose and they did not disappoint.  They paired up nicely to my s7 and the jbl app was very easy to use. I have a feeling I will be buying a couple more to put in other rooms in our house. Buy them you will not be let down .
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good speaker,5,Great sound and battery life. Great look. Easy to use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound at a great price.  Very satisfied,5,This speaker sits on our kitchen window sill and cranks out awesome sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I previously had the Altec Mini Lifejacket and liked it just fine,5,"I am completely impressed with this speaker!  I previously had the Altec Mini Lifejacket and liked it just fine, but the sound quality doesn't even compare to this one!  Even on medium volume, this speaker is loud from across a big room and the bass is superb!  I also LOVE the turquoise color and the fact that I don't have to worry about it falling in the pool/lake by accident.  4 star product by far!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Spend your stimulus check, this is a great speaker.",5,"Looking for a small but loud portable bluetooth speaker? Don't look any further, this speaker is great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice Stereo Speakers,5,Picked up a pair of these speakers for use while traveling. They are compact. I love the stereo sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good portable,4,"I used this device in the garage, in the bath room when taking a shower and outside on the patio when swimming.  Now if it would have the capability to start the app on my phone when it's connected and start playing music that would have been a definite plus."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy this,5,Love it! The sound and base is better than any other Bluetooth device I have owned.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This thing is great!,5,"This thing is great!  I am picky about sound quality but also spend a lot of time outdoors at our house on the water. This is a very good solution to get very decent sound in a small device with weather resistance. Easy to pair with blue tooth. Several members of the family have paired it and it sticks, although they may have to reconnect, but it shows up on their iPhone for example.  Well made, good sounding easy to use."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker!,5,I ordered it yesterday and got it today. Sounds amazing. I've always used cheaper speakers and obviously got what I paid for them ?? I heard JBL were good speakers so I had to try. Cant wait to use this for a while!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Bought this item for my wife and she really likes it! Great product!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Haven’t used it enough yet,4,I’ve only used it for 10Minutes
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a little speaker!,5,"I love this speaker, I bought my wife a Bose revolve which was the best sounding speaker I had heard till I got this. The Bose is very nice, but the Flip 4 offers better mid range, and a voice forward sound to me. The fact that it's water proof is amazing, and the battery last forever at 50% or so. Great buy for this price range!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente calidad y servicio.,5,"Excelente calidad de sonido. El tamaño es muy bueno, se ve la buena calidad de los materiales que componen el artículo. Recomendado 100%"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Upgrade,4,Solid product. I had the flip 3 for 2 summers and the charge port broke so I could no longer charge it. I decided to upgrade to the 4. It is definantly more crisp and has more pop than the 3. Battery is a little bit better but would like more. I like the camo design haven’t seen many like this.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Mint,5,It's perfect for just chillin out and listening to some tunes.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Packs great sound into a small package,5,great sound from this little speaker strapped to my bicycle handlebars. Would recommend this to everyone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",SATISFIED,5,"Fantastic speaker in every way! Beautiful, clear, loud sound. I could not be more pleased. Bose look out!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Spectacular sound quality!!!,5,"Spectacular sound quality, and great bass for the price. This speaker is very comparable to 125-175 dollar speakers. It is a must for anyone looking for a great waterproof speaker with awesome sound quality. I have the ocean blue color and it looks amazing. I thought it would be a little bit more of a blue color but it works for me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life not so good... returning.,3,"I really liked but a bit tiney in the sound. Like they have it set to “vocal” enhancement. The bass is there but the battery is clearly lacking.I played at 2/3 volume two separate times and the red light came on after four hours. I’m returning due to poor battery life. It states 12 hours but not likely for casual use. Definitely has promise but they need to add a better battery.  I believe it’s only a Built-in 3,000mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery supports up to 12 hours of playtime at moderate volume levels but they need like a 5200 mAh to get like 7/8 hours if your out with out a charger, say like camping.It’ll come just not this year.There are better options with out the price tag."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for teenagers!!,5,"I have a granddaughter that loves to listen to music while in the shower. I got her this for Christmas and she loves it. She says it is durable and well worth my money...ok. I have to agree with her because she is notorious for breaking everything she gets in the first week, however, her JBL Flip 4 is still going so it has to be tough."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Liked it so much we bought 2,5,"Easy to connect, great sound quality and long battery life. This was a great buy. We liked it so much we bought a second one to pair as well. With the app you can play multiple JBL units through one device."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great product, great bass for its size and fun to have around",5,"Love the sound it produces. High quality for it size. I just wish it had a lot more battery life... I mean. Don’t get me wrong it lasts a good few hours. But I’m just being ungrateful here hehe. It’s a great product don’t doubt that. Buy it, don’t second guess. The battery life is good, again I just want battery tech to get better in general."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is my first blue tooth speaker and I love it. I did a ton of product reviews ...,5,"This is my first blue tooth speaker and I love it. I did a ton of product reviews on Amazon, YouTube, and from friends before settling on this one. Glad I did.I use it a lot at work, when Messing around in the garage, and when working out, and one charge could easily last me the whole week if stuck without power, although I usually recharge it every three to four days just to make sure I'm good when I need it. Great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Obviously sound quality ratings are relative to other units it its class, but I've been very happy with this speaker.  It connects easily and sounds remarkably good relative to its size and price point."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL does it again,5,I am so fascinated how extremely great this speaker is for only a whopping 100$ dollars. I would buy this speaker for 300$. An absolute steal!Pros:-Great mid range and hi range-EXTREMELY LOUD!!-Waterproof ip7-Easy to clean with running water-Amazing design-Very long battery life-Extreme compatibilityCons:-heavy bass will make the speaker quieter and makes a little bit of distortion (for rap music) but that is to be expected with a speaker of this size.Well done JBL
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for portable sound,5,"I enjoyed the ease of use, sound quality, and battery life so much on my own that I bought a second one for a gift. I hang mine in the garage to play music while working there, and my wife has hers in the bathroom. The quality of sound for these little things is impressive, and the battery life is several hours.  Extremely happy with these speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Waterproof!!! Gotta love it,4,All around it’s pretty awesome the only reason it doesn’t have 5 stars is the design doesn’t have a flat spot like a stand. Just a personal opinion because if you bump it it will roll. In the sand though it just chills. Ohh and sound is amazing. Very surprised with the clarity and quality of sound with such a small unit.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice quality,4,Very nice sound. Daughter loves it
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Sounds great, keep a charger handy tho....",3,"I've had this speaker for about 3 weeks now. The sound quality is good, but the battery life is maybe a third of advertised. ( about 4 hours )  I have charged to 100% and used it intermittently, about 30 min at a time, and I have gone from a 100% charge to 0% in a single use. Both ways battery life was about 4 hours."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will always buy JBL!,5,If you’re looking for a simple speaker you cannot go wrong it’s very loud. Perfect for using in small setting like in a garage out at a bonfire or inside.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality and ez to pair to an I-phone.,5,This  speaker is outstanding! Sound quality is super and can get good volume out of it. I will buy another to pair  them for outside activity. Recommend highly. Best speaker I’ve ever had.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product that delivers,5,Love this speaker for podcasts and pretty much all audio venues.I don't get good results with videos on YouTube or Netflix.  The sound is behind the video so it not in synch.But still give 5 Stars because I purchased specifically for audio platforms
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,"We are really pleased with the sound quality.  Plenty of sound on the deck listening to music with friends, or just in the kitchen listening to a podcast."

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, portable and easy to pair with phone",5,I've had several portable wireless speakers and this one by far provides the best sound for the money. I use it with a transmitter on my TV to listen to shows when my kids are asleep and take it camping. It's so easy to use my 8 year old borrows it all the time to listen to music on his Kindle. Worth the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Long battery life, waterproof, great sound",5,"Wow. Bought this for a float trip last weekend (26JUL19-28JUL19) sound quality is wonderful. Had the speaker in the bottom of the canoe, no worries with water. Speaker lasted over 12 hours at volumes between 60-100% probably 70% on average. The speaker actually didn’t die, we just went to bed, so it could’ve had another couple of hours. Very very happy with this purchase!"

Only downside is that it did not come with a wall plug in, just a cord."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"2cd speaker from jbl I’ve had, first one lasted about 5 years. Great speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Solid build, goood sound",5,I bought this small model for my wife. She likes to listen to streaming music on her phone speaker.

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Small, cute, & loud af",5,"Bought this as a house-warming gift for my friend who just moved into a new apt on his own. We opened it & tried it out as soon as we got to his place.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small Speaker with Loud Sound and Impressive Bass,5,"I love this speaker!! It's durable (has handled many drops). It's waterproof (assuming you shut the charging cover). It has a lot of bass for a small speaker and it has loud volume for a smaller sized speaker. Although I would 100% recommend this speak, definitely check out the JBL Charge 3 (it's similar to this but a little bigger). It definitely depends on what you're looking for but I love this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would buy again,5,"I work in a manufacturing plant which is pretty loud. Its not loud enough to hear over all the power tools going at once, but is pretty loud and has great sound quality.  Im pleased.

Audio quality is really good, and the bluetooth range is notable too.

The stereo link works seamlessly with other JBL portable speakers. Will buy another soon!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,"This was a gift to myself and I love it. The sound is absolutely amazing and I used it without even charging it and to have not been charged up, used straight out the box I will say I got a solid 6 hours out of it!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to connect blue tooth.. good sound,5,Love this product... ordered a second. One upstairs and one downstairs.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,"So far so good! Mids & highs are pretty comparable to the Flip 3 I have but the bass hits harder making a better complete listening experience in my opinion. The battery life seems to be drastically improved from the Flip 3 as well so as long as it holds up, I won't need to hunt for a new speaker ANYTIME SOON"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Cuts in and out and a lot of static when synced.,3,So far so good. The only thing is that when using both there is a ton of static and they cut in and out while playing music and they are not even turned up loud. Separately they work fine but when syncing them together it’s terrible I might be sending them both back and getting something else.2/27/18 Update: I've had the speakers ( I am only using one at the moment) for maybe two weeks now. The battery life on this is not great at all. I charged it for a full day and used the very next day on a low volume and the battery was at half percent the next morning. It's a good speaker; loud and the bass is great but overall the battery life sucks.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Easy to set up and connect multiple for party mode or stereo.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works well outside,5,Works well outside and inside and clear
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A $80 speaker that has the sound quality of a $200 speaker,5,"For the price and the quality this is literally an amazing speaker, I don’t even write reviews, but tons of people have commented on how great the sound quality is and how smooth the bass is. I’ve only had it for a week and a half now. The battery life is great, the sound is crisp and clean. A co worker wants me to order a second one for him."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Excellent sound for the size of the unit. Great range, both high end and bass.",5,"Great product. Seems like it's very good quality and durable. Excellent sound for the money and the size of the unit. Considering getting their older, bigger sibling."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Great product. Only thing is when the base in the music is too loud it make the music sound horrible. You just have to turn it down. The speaker get loud especially in a small room. I think it’s an awesome speaker for someone looking for a travel size speaker! This speaker is worth the money!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great “BANG” for the buck!,5,"It’s a very well made and quite “substantial” little speaker. The sound is quite surprising from such a small package. The price point was an excellent deal and good value for money. I would definitely recommend it, if you are in the market for a compact Bluetooth speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stops playing after 39 mins - shuts down!,3,"I like the sound a lot however, it will play for 39 min then shut down and I have to keep restarting-defective.  I waited to late to try it and missed exchange/ return timeframe  so I’m stuck with it."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase!,5,I ordered this to replace our JBL Flip 2 that has worn out.  I ordered it based on a review that stated the battery life was longer than the Flip 3.  So far the Flip 4 has not disappointed.  The sound is great and has small subwolfers on the end which is a great improvement over the Flip 2.  It has been to the beach and we had zero issues with its performance.  We love the Flip 4!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker I've Had!! ????,5,"At first I saw some reviews about how it dies after a few months, but I ordered it anyways. Thank god I did because it is the best speaker I've ever had and it sounds great!! Guys I swear to you, you should buy it if you want it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, terrible battery life",3,"Pound for pound maybe the best sounding portable bluetooth speaker - Battery does not last worth a crap , ""12 hour"" claim is ludicrous unless they meant at the absolute lowest volume setting.I'm lucky to get 3 with this brand new unit, and the Flip 3 I had was the same.At work today played it on full volume from 7am to 9:30am break, battery meter was flashing red and ready to die.Charged it for 20 minutes at break, lasted about an hour before it died - So thats 3.5 hours, and that with an extra 20 minutes of charging. I am tempted to think it is defective, but like I said, the Flip 3 was the same, great sound and terrible battery life."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Perfection,5,"JBL knows what they’re doing. If you’re on the fence, pick this up! Highly recommend. Great portability/size, amazing sound and holds a charge. I haven’t tested the waterproof claims and hopefully won’t need to comment on that. Amazon offers a great price. Snap it up!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",EXCELLENT,5,"I love these speakers.  They sound great, they look cool, and are relatively inexpensive. My only knock would be the instructions are in the universal language of pictures.  And the pictures let's say, could be a little more clear.  But all in all very happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",To hear my music clearly.,4,There is a bit of static sound when I listen to music.  Like the speaker is busted. And it was my first and only time using it. So I will find out more next round if that static sound is still there or if it goes away.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker...definitely worth buying,4,"This is a pretty good speaker as long as you are not trying to blast music on it. It has a excellent bass which surprised me but the sound gets distorted if you have the volume of your audio source too high, otherwise it is a cool little speaker. JUL states that there is 12 hours of play but I have gotten way more than 12"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Review,5,I got this speaker for Christmas and I use it all of the time. I usually play it on quarter volume or so and it'll last me about 4 days of use for 4 hours each day. It has great sound quality and very good bass. I would 100% recommend this speaker to anyone who is interested in a mid range high quality speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect!,5,Works perfect for the garage when out there drinking cold ones! ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WOW!!!!,5,"I just can not believe how this thing sounds. Music in the shower, on the boat and at the pool now. Fantastic!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Definitely worth the buy.,5,Sound quality was higher than expected and carried well even outside.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounding speaker - great gift,5,Got this as a birthday gift for my husband last year and he really likes it.  The sound quality is great.  He primarily uses it in the backyard.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super quality!,5,Super quality!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,4,"Great little speaker, I only wish I bought two!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker with big sound,5,"Works awesome ! Very pleased with the sound quality . Wasn’t sure what to expect, the Bluetooth connects almost instantly once you power on the speaker . For being so small it puts off plenty of sound and actually has decent bass. Would definitely recommend especially for the price ."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive Sound for a small speaker,5,"Easily have gotten 30+ feet from my phone with it still working.Sound is missing a little in the low end, but that is expected in such a small speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not that great for price.,3,"I give it 3 stars for the convenience of it being portable, the bluetooth, and the battery life.  The sound isn't very good and I wish I had returned it.  For the money, I expected more, sadly disappointed.  I do use it, but only because I don't want to pay for another nice portable speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Don’t hesitate, buy it!",5,"Great sound, price, easily portable and easy to use. Only thing we would have loved is a carrying case but otherwise fantastic little speaker that packs a punch of sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best waterproof speaker,5,I have had this about three years and still works. The battery life last for days before I have to charge it and it is loud for being a small as it is. The quality of the sound is great too. I have also taken it on the river multiple times and it still works!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good price, great sound!",5,"Small size, great sound. I use while working on  my rc car."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy.,5,"Connected instantly,  easily jumps between phone and computer and back.  Sounds is amazing,  use it for ambiance when playing table top games,  and it fills the whole room.  Only have to recharge it every few sessions,  but it charges quickly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",pretty decent speaker,5,I've had it for a month with no issues. Holds up on in the shower (not directly under heavy water but a few splashes hasn't hurt it). I'm a professional musician and i think the sound and volume quality is pretty decent for its size. I also haven't had any issue with the battery.  it also hooks up to my iphone 8s just fine
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,4,The sound quality is great. Battery life lasted more like 8 hours
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente relación Costo Beneficio,5,"Muy buen sonido, esta por encima de otros equipos de similar precio. Me encanta"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A good product.,5,Wonderful sound and very easy to set-up and use. A good product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Take anywhere,5,Sounds good. Connects well. Good battery charge retention and usable duration.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid portable speaker,5,"Loving it. A little lacking in highs, but still sounds great. Great for the price!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, great price.",5,"Perfect for me.  Great sound, easy to use, portable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Short battery but great speaker,4,This is a fantastic speaker if you keep it close to an outlet with a charger. Water proof but won’t be affective on the beach because it won’t last that long.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality,5,Sound is incredible love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker I've ever had for every reason,5,"Great battery life - over 3 weeks of shower use easy and 1 week of heavy use easy. Very durable, dropped on concrete a few times. Waterproofing is top notch and for the price the slight bass boost on the higher model doesn't make sense."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",box was in perfect condition. Still testing out the sound quality but ...,5,"Shipping was very fast (even for a prime order I think it came next day!), box was in perfect condition.  Still testing out the sound quality but so far it seems great! I was between this product and the Bose sound link mini, but reviews suggested this had better base sound, overall I am glad I went with this speaker because it was cheaper and the sound seems pretty good for a smaller speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","The device is great, but the software is garbage",3,"We now own 2 of these, and although the sound quality is very good, pairing them is a slog.JBL claims that you can connect dozens of these at once, in stereo mode, and have a party. The reality of it, is that you can only do this from a mobile device, using their horrible app, that almost never even detects the flippin' devices. You can have them connected to your phone, and the app can't find them.I did manage to get them connected in stereo mode at one point, but when I fiddled with the settings, I lost that connection, and gave up trying after another half hour of restarting, resetting, etc.Bottom line, is buy ONE, and enjoy it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Bought for daughter (she picked out) and she still uses this all the time after having this for little over a yr. Still works great!! She picked out the teal color and it's beautiful.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great, little speaker!",5,This speaker is perfect for my uses. I really appreciate not worrying about it getting damaged when I take it outside in rain or snow.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,This connects to your Bluetooth easily. Great sound. I pair 2 of them and use them for all my music. Good tone quality and volume
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker!,5,"This thing is great! Clear sound, great battery life!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will not keep change dor 12 hours,5,Fully charged i only get 6 hours why can you help me. Thanks
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy!,5,Great sound and portability. I like it loud so battery goes quicker but great buy!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Quality,5,I bought this speaker as a birthday gift for my dad. He takes it out on the boat with him and LOVES it. A much needed upgrade from the old radio he used to tote around with him.Highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Tab cover for port is bad,4,Sounds and looks good. Didn't know about the sleep setting. Only this I don't like is how annoying the tab is to flip up to get to the charging port. Pain in the ass I have to leave it up a bit so it doesn't get stuck
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery Life needs improvement,3,"i like how convenient it is and it has good quality of sound, though if you put it to max volume it kills the battery faster than you can listen to a few songs."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound... Bad drop protection,3,Good sounding speaker. Very nice to hold and use.ine broke from falling into asphalt from about 2 feet and it was toast. If you don't drop things this will be a good speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,I got this a while back and I'm only writing the review now after months of testing and I have to say I love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Low battery life,3,"I gave this product 3 stars because after 1 year and half , the battery life is next to nothing. I have to charge it daily just to listen to it for a few hours every other day. It is very annoying for your “Bluetooth” speaker to always need a charge while you are playing it. It also does NOT charge while you are listening to music. If it is dead then you have to wait for a full charge before listening again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent overall speaker,4,Overall decent speaker. Durable thus far to heat as well as cold/moisture.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality Speaker,5,I’ve always trusted JBL and they haven’t let me down.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Don't  buy,5,They are junk you get even a little bit of water and it quits workingTried two no more
"JBL Flip 4, Black",love ittttt!,5,Great speaker for a great price! Totally worth it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really good speaker!,5,I am very happy with this product! The sound is as good as my old Bose Bluetooth! And much less expensive!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it,5,"Purchased the 5, but later found out it couldn't be wired so I purchased the 4 and now use it for phone, computer and TV. Haven't figured out how to get Alexia's voice over it??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Superb quality,5,These are amazing speakers!!!! I wish I bought 10 more because I found them at target for more than double the price! JBL has been really dominating the portable speaker market since the beginning. These are such Hugh quality I’m so impressed!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You won't be disappointed!,5,"This is amazing, the sound quality and bass are awesome and I like the color as well. I highly recommend this, it is an improvement to the Flip 3, which we also have. JBL has yet to disappoint.*I bought a case for it separately which is shown in the pictures.*I took two pictures to show the coloration with and without flash."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and portability,5,Great sound and portability. Good quality and battery life. Love it so much I purchased two.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic speaker,5,Only downside is it will shut down if you pause the music for about 3 minutes. Otherwise its great. Good sound quality easy to get working.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,Great sound and easy to use. Just had to take it out of the box and it was ready to go!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Awesome sound, long battery life, does fine around water and in the hot sun, pretty long Bluetooth range."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best small speaker i have ever owned. I strap to to my bicycle and enjoy .,5,Great product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love love love,5,"Love this speaker!! I take it everywhere....my daughters softball and soccer games, the beach, friends, you name it!! The battery life is exceptional and the sound quality is excellent.  Highly recommend this product"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Grade articulated sound,5,"Brilliant new way to enjoy a Music. Don’t bother with headphones any longer, set it in my lap, on a pillow behind the back of my head or dance around with it In my backyard. So much fun, great  articulated sound. You’ll find louder more appropriate speakers for group situations But this is spectacular for personal use"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than Bose,5,"So much better than Bose Soundlink Mini! Better sound, durability, battery life"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to set up,5,"Easy to set up. Very Good sound quality.  I wish it was flat on both ends so it could stand up without being tilted. That being said, it has fallen off the shelf several times and is still working well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente sonido,5,"Un sonido espectacular, para el tamaño del parlante, los bajos suenan muy bien."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, well made",5,"I was impressed with the audio - great bass that’s rich and full. Highs are crisp too. Blows away the cheap speakers I had ($30 range). Hope the battery holds up better than that one did too. The startup/shutdown tone is annoying, wish there was a way to stop that. Overall I am very happy and my music sounds great (classical,jazz,rock,punk,blues,country,pretty much every genre)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty cool little speaker! Sounds outstanding,5,Pretty cool little speaker! Sounds outstanding
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,Good just what I was looking for at a good price
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy bueno,5,Suena muy bien en espacios cerrados tipo salón o habitación. No lo he ensayado al aire libre
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Died after a year of Use,3,"I have owned this speaker for a year and a few months. I really love this speaker and am surprised it did not last longer. Now it dies after two songs and being fully charged. Really disappointing as I thought I would get at least 3 to 5 years out of this speaker. I had moderate use and did not use it every day - just on weekends and for camping trips. The sound quality is awesome. I wish the battery life was awesome too. I can only get a hour of listen time on it now, if it is plugged in and charging - but still dies while connected to the charger after an hour. Super bummed about it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Thumbs up,5,The sound quality out of such a small product is exactly what I needed.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Reliability,4,"I already own one JBL Flip 4 speaker, so I recently bought another one so that I could enhance the sound when I play music outdoors next to a pool. But when I connected both at the same time, it created scratching sound and interruptions."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,4,"Sound quality is just what I expected from JBL.  Easy to connect with any source, and battery life longer than most other similar products that I have.  Very happy with this purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"Speaker can take some wear and tear, and dust.  Great battery life.  Comes with a decently long charging cord.  Boyfriend takes this speaker with him every where he goes.  Cannot yet attest to the speaker's waterproofness as it has not yet made it into the water...  Extremely great value for what you get.  Highly recommend."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",These are worth the money,5,"I have bought two of these and my friend has several at different sizes.  They are AWESOME and easy to link for surround sound.  Beyond that the sound quality is good for the size.  There are cheaper options out there, and I have bought them, but these are worth the added cost over no name cheap speakers."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Not bad, but there is better",4,"Sounds ok, but my Boss SoundLink Mini II sounds much better. I do like that the Flip 4 is weather resistant, and it's more mobile-friendly than the Bose. It's great for taking to the pool.  The battery charge lasts longer, too. Wish it came with an adapter with the USB cable. Overall, it's worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker is awesome!  Works great and sound fantastic!,5,Connects immediately and sound is great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",love the sound but I deduct one star for not ...,4,"love the sound but I deduct one star for not having a ""disconnect all"" button.  anyone in range can connect and I see no way of disconnecting them.  guess I can try powering off and then on but a quick button push would be nice.  would love to see some sort of ""user authentication"" to only allow valid connections from my devices."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get the Flop 5 or Something Different,1,"Was excited to get this $100 speaker because I’ve had a cheapish ($30) one for awhile that definitely did the job but just didn’t have the loudness/quality I was looking for. While this speaker definitely gets louder than that one and offers better sound quality, it really isn’t that loud. The loudest volume setting also sounds pretty cloudy and weird. This thing also will just continually pause my music and won’t continue playing until I completely forget the device from my phone and reconnect. The bass on this is also pretty bad. It’s almost like it can’t handle it? Songs with heavy bass will muffle all other aspects of the song which makes them kind of unlistenable. Pretty disappointed with this speaker. I honestly would suggest getting a cheaper off-brand one or maybe just going the extra mile and getting the Flip 5? But I also don’t really know the specs/quality on that one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would reccomend,5,I love this jbl speaker that I had to gift this to my boyfriend !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL replaced my Flip 4 under warranty,5,About 5 months of use my Flip 4 wouldn’t connect to the charging cable. The charging port had become loose. I called JBL and e-mailed them a screenshot of my Amazon order and they emailed me back a UPS label for return. I got a new Flip 4 about 10 days later. I’m very pleased with the speaker and especially the customer service.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,Survived a kayak flip great for fishing and small gatherings one tough machine
"JBL Flip 4, Black",More than enough sound for family parties,5,Loved the look and feel. Bass is more than I need for my home use and I even bought two to use in party or stereo mode.Both modes worked fine. Stereo mode had a little lag to start the song on the second speaker. I hope it gets sorted out with updates
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a great little speaker,4,"This is a great little speaker. Sounds good and is super portable. However, I've already started having issues with the port to where you attach the charger cable. You have to really hold it in place with a bit of force and have it rest just so otherwise it stops charging. Going to replace the provided charging cable and hope that solves the problem"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great.,5,Bought as a gift 5 months ago. Gets used almost every day. Thing is awesome.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Solid Product!,5,For the money a great product!  Fills the room with sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome little speaker,5,Pros: Compact..Easy to use...Love it!  Cons: Haven’t found any yet!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect Outdoor Speaker,5,Great sound. Love the size for portability yet has the sound of a giant speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I will never buy a brand new JBL speaker from ...,5,I will never buy a brand new JBL speaker from a store again after this purchase. This is the same as brand new for half the money. I have two other JBL speakers and I assure you all the packaging was factory and looked just the same as the ones I opened brand new. I will continue to look at other products by this company because they did such a pronominal job beating my expectations.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","If you need to, just buy two",5,"Bought it for my husband, did a connect and play and now I just have to have my own because it has really good sound, bass could be better but for a small portable speaker I'm impressed by the quality"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound balance,5,"For the amount of money I paid, this little speaker  wows.  It puts out great sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",easy to use,5,very east to set up and use. its not as loud as I wanted it to be but I like to not be able to hear myself talk loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works amazing!,5,I am so glad I bought it. It is definitely water proof got caught in the rain with it and worked perfectly in the rain and after. The sound is amazing. It’s the perfect size to take any where!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it! At some Wal-Mart stores they have these ...,5,"Love it! At some Wal-Mart stores they have these set up to try out... This Flip 4 is just as loud as the Charge 3 it seems, I mean, almost exactly the same loudness!  Regarding sound quality, it sounds absolutley fantastic and way better than the JBL CHarge 3. The CHarge 3 is muffled compared to this. Anyway, if you like LOUD, this thing gets pretty dang loud for a small room. Blah blah blah, buy it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We're big fans of JBL BT speakers and how you can pair many of them.,5,We stuck with JBL 4's because the new models use a new pairing technology.  These worked great with our other 3s and 4s
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,"Use 2 of these at our pool and getting a couple more for the patio and garage areas for parties.  Easy to use, sound is great, and decent price.  Love these speakers - perfect for us."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",N/A,5,N/A
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and battery life.,5,Love this speaker. Sounds great and plays quite a while.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Mailman loves this.,5,I'm a P.O. letter carrier and this is the perfect solution for listening to music in my truck or walking a route.  It's rugged and waterproof.  The sound is good and I usually only need half volume outside and a bit more inside the noisy truck.  The battery lasts me two full work days before I need to charge it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very Good Speaker,5,Dual drivers was what sold me on the 4 instead of the 5
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice sound and bass,5,"Awesome sound! takes the place of the old Boom Box only with much better sound, when a bunch of us are hanging out. IMO opinion, it has plenty of bass, clarity and volume. I'm not an expert but I do look for a great sound to satisfy myself and others around the group, the Flip4 has it.Battery life is about 4 hours, I guess, it hasn't run out on us yet.I would recommend this to my friends."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,I like it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Quality is great,5,So much sound for such a small speaker. Love it!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommend this,5,We are impressed with this.  It’s really nice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,I got it as a birthday present and it works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom!! Exactly what I need!,5,Wow that’s a bad ass little speaker. Paid 100 and you’ll have the coolest party ever!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small with a Punch,5,"I tested 3 other waterproof speakers, and this one was the smallest of the 3 and it outperformed all of them by leaps and bounds. The distance the bluetooth picks up is as advertised, and the sound quality is superb at it's highest level. Additionally the base is unreal for such a small speaker. Overall couldn't be more impressed. I use to have a bose mini, and it's better than that one and the bose isn't water proof!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A product you won't regret,5,It's perfect. You see those thousands of 5-Star reviews? They're there for a reason.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow! Sounds great!,5,Bought 2 to take advantage of stereo option. Really great sound. Bas is strong.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Gift for Music Lovers!,5,"My daughter was thrilled to receive the JBL speaker for her Birthday! My adult children love the flexibility of this traveling water proof speaker! I have it in blue, my son has it in red and daughter in grey! It’s great item for people who love music!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, great durability",3,"Great sound, great durability, and I would definitely purchase one as a gift. I've had friends remark about the sound quality, being surprised it was coming from such a little thing.I've not tested the waterproofness, nor do I care to. It's fine right where it is on the dry countertop away from water sources.UPDATE: I had to bump it down from 5 stars because it's no longer holding a charge and every now and then it'll fritz out and make a ton of static noise. I've treated it very carefully and I never max out the volume or yank the charge cable out. I certainly expected this speaker to last more than a year, especially for the price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it.,5,So far so happy with this. Shipping was super fast. And the quality of this speaker is amazing. Easy to use and understand. Also love the connect+ feature. Most likely will order another one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Get the charge 2,4,"I returned this and got the charge 2, way better sound quality and volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice speaker,5,Love my jbl had to get another flip 4 to link the 2 speakers since jbl does not make speakers link w/any other # like the flip 5 wont link w/flip 4
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great quality speaker,5,"Absolutely love the speaker! Amazing sound quality and fits comfortably in my purse for the road. The battery life is also good and charges pretty quickly even when in use. The only negative thing is that the micro usb charging cable that came with the speaker stopped working just a week or two after getting it. It might not be the main product, but it certainly isn't what you'd expect with a product of quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You'll Love Them !,5,"Great sounding, waterproof, Bluetooth speaker ! Use them with your phone or anything Bluetooth or plug your sound source in. They give Great, Loud ,Sound in a small EZ to pack package..And now that a new model came out, these are discounted ,if you can find them...Highly recommended !"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great gift to give,5,Bought this for my husband for our Anniversary and he loves it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AWESOME. MUST,5,"This thing rocks.  The bass bumps!  Link with your friends for surround sound.  Use at the beach at the park on your bike or skateboard.  Literally anywhere.  I was on a canoe that capsized, the speaker was at the bottom of a puddle, completely immersed in water still playing music!!  Took it out and kept on going.  AWESOME.  MUST BUY"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You won't regret getting this speaker!,5,"The quality, overall, is beyond the average. I believe most of you will be satisfied with the speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,I absolutely love this. I love it and I recommend it. The battery life is awesome. The volume is perfect. Its also a nice size so it’s not a big bulky thing and not too small. It makes for a great gift. Decent price and great quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love JBL,5,"Sounds great, looks awesome, charges fast, connects easy, idk what else to say... battery life is little shorter than advertised but it only takes 20 minutes to recharge so not a big deal"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speakers especially when you pair 2 of them in stereo mode,5,very very well made but they should change to the C Cord for charging
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Solid, Little Speaker",5,"Easy to connect. I had this up and running in less than two minutes. Good sound, with a decent bass response for a ""pill"" speaker. It feels sturdy and well built also."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great product,5,Nice sound great product for the money
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker,5,Super sturdy. Looks great! The sound is amazing and I love the bass. Good size too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I am delighted with my Bluetooth,5,"This little $75.00 speaker provides better sound quality than the Advent stereo I paid $1200. for in 1980. I put on some Ludwig Von, hang the Bluetooth from a ceiling hook, and it fills the house with sound. Delightful!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice upgrade over my old jambox,5,Sound great and battery life is great. A nice upgrade over my old jam box.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,Would buy this again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE IT,5,"this is by far a good speaker to have its water proof and it’s a nice and loud speaker, you can actually feel the bass with the speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Power,5,"Esta bocinita se oye alto ,sobrepasó mis expectativas ,la recomiendo 100 %"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,Omg this speaker is so loud. I knew that it had good reviews but once i officially tried it i realized what a great speaker it was. The battery lasts a long time and is easy to connect my phone to.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small but mighty,5,Great speaker to take everywhere! Sound quality is super too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!!,5,Perfect for the beach and in my apartment
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great music to your ears,5,Works great by the pool or hit tub.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Won't hold a charge,3,"The sound quality is great. With that being said, it doesn't hold its charge. I have to keep it plugged into it's charger from day one. My son and daughter both have one of these speakers and have the same problem with their speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Poor battery life,2,The battery life is so terrible
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic!,5,"Great sound, easy set up, perfect for my desk and the case makes travel with the flip easy!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom for the room,5,"This has the bass, depth, and output to take over for some party speakers. The protection on it is an added bonus. I struggle just a bit opening the spot to charge the device, but that’s good to keep it waterproof. The flap does press on the charge cable so be wary of the cable getting bent and no longer charging, and fixed by getting a new cable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Battery life shorter, sound quality great",4,"Doesn't last quite as long as it should on a full battery.  Otherwise, the sound is great!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Funciona muy bien,4,Todo funciona correctamente
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Really love this! Good bass, great overall sound, only wish it could (maybe?!) go a little louder - although I’m sure my neighbors are glad it doesn’t LOL Really good value."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,"The sound is great, I like the bass that comes with it compared to other portable speakers. Durable and good battery."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jbl speaker,5,The sound is great and everyone ask me were did i buy it. Its a good quality speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works but...,3,Pretty good sound but if you turn it up at all the bass rattles the subs and I'm not a fan of that. I think next time I'll just go with a Ultimate Ears. Battery life is ok.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the price.,5,"After reading reviews of various portable speakers, this one seemed consistently positive. I have to agree with them. I was impressed with the sound quality. The clarity and bass. I bought it only to view movies on my tablet. The on and off sound effect is ""a little weird.""  I haven't tested it outdoors, but it's definitely worth the purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",These sound great,5,Great bass for a small speaker.  I love that I can link 2.  Use them in my classic convertible and still loud enough with top down.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!,5,Performs great and is super durable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm am very happy with the sound very crisp & clean,4,"Just purchased one. I'm am very happy with the sound very crisp & clean. The size is just right for carrying it in a back pack or a carry case. It is also water proof, for those fun swimming party's. I also like that you can link other JBL4's for a nice stereo affect or putting them in different rooms in the house..Thanks!! JBL"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!,5,I love the speaker! It's loud and has good base! Battery last forever!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",excellent,5,"High quality, accessible and easy to operate. powerful."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I use this thing nearly everyday.,5,Great versatile speaker. Use it in the shower. Use it for podcast while working. Use it on the kayak while fishing. Fits in the water bottle cage while I’m biking. I’m not an audiophile but I think it sounds great for its size/price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!,5,"Gave it to dad as bday gift and he loves it! Changed his music experience. Sound is full great, battery life, all straight forward."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,This is actually the second speaker we have purchased.  The first one has worked beautifully for the last year and the sound quality is fantastic so we purchased a second one because you can link them.  Now we can go back and forth between the inside of the house to the backyard and have continuous music playing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Almost perfect, quite happy",5,"It is almost perfect for what I use it for, listening to audiobooks in my bedroom and shower.  If it had faster idle shutdown and a dimmer power button it would be perfect.  It seems pretty durable, has long battery life, and is pretty waterproof.  Its on off sound is not too jarring though it is a little loud sometimes."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy it,5,Worth every penny! Sound quality and volume limits are great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stop looking and just buy it,5,"Very versatile. Connects simply, nice sound, great price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny!,5,"We’ve been using our speaker on our kayaking trips. The sound quality is excellent, and being water resistant gives us peace of mind while on the water."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",THE BEST!!!,5,"I love this little Speaker!!! Music sounds Great!!! Battery life Great! It lasted over 8hrs at Max Volume! More than what I expected. Great for the beach,hikes,pool side,bike rides, picnics, at the park. And its really great in the bathroom! But where it does lack is the mic when using it to have conversations over your phone. Not so Great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Quality,5,"I had the JBL Flip2 for several years and I damaged the charging port.  The Flip4 sounds better and has a few nice features (connecting multiple speakers together; and waterproof).  It also holds the charge longer than the previous version.  What was even more impressive is when I ordered it on a Saturday night with Prime shipping, it was to arrive on Wednesday.  Monday at noon it arrived and it shipped from the west coast."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",smiles,5,"I have a couple of these types of speakers and this one is very nice. The winner is that it connects to another similar speaker. (left/right).. For around the house...by the campfire- very nice, on the pier-very nice, doing yard work - very nice... wouldn't want to carry TWO on a trip or such but very happy and would get again.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and battery life!,5,"This speaker does not disappoint! Sound quality is great and the price is good! One of the things I like the most is that my buddy has one and we link them together at work or on the boat which amplifies the music even more! Also great if you like fishing or kayak fishing, goes anywhere and the battery’s last for a long time! Great buy"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker!!,5,Absolutely what I wanted !!Plenty of extra sound with very good clear quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality speaker with minor setbacks,5,I like the bass and the sound quality of the speaker. I don’t like that you can’t see what percentage the speaker has when the Bluetooth is on iPhone or iPad. I don’t like that the speaker doesn’t come with a base dock to charge the speaker with the cable they provide. The battery life is good and portability is great.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Sound, Fair battery",5,Great Sound! I just wish the battery would last a little longer. I've had previous versions of JBL speakers and I have to say the older ones still have better battery life than the new ones.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",... as a gift for my significant other as we love music and to be on the go,5,"Purchased as a gift for my significant other as we love music and to be on the go. This waterproof speaker is great for hiking, kayaking, hanging poolside, etc. Small enough to carry or clip onto something, but have the deep rich sound of a high quality speaker. The bass is great! Stays charged for a good amount of time and love to get another and test the jbl connect+ ! Highly recommend this for almost any situation!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,It is perfect for taking to the beach and my office . I use it at home also to stream my music and Sirius radio stations
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s worth the money spent!!,5,"Best Speaker I have ever had. I have owned multiple beats pills and other items from Sony and Samsung and this one beats them all. It’s small with the biggest punch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Don’t think twice, instead buy 2 for you.  LOL"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality.,5,JBL makes the best speakers out there. I just bought mine for a fantastic price and it is the best speaker that money can buy. One thing to consider is that Toyota vehicles use these speakers in all of their vehicles. Toyota is the number 1 selling brand in the world. So that says alot that they would use JBL for their audio source.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speakers is amazing,5,This speaker is amazing! Don’t knowMuch about speakers but the sound is crisp and the bass is noticeable. I love this thing! Battery life is good. I’m considering purchasing another one so you can have a left and right speaker. Just download the JBL app. I highly recommended this Bluetooth speaker. Thanks JBL for making an awesome speaker.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Off details about the package I received,4,"The only reason I’m writing this is because they package I had received is labeled as “new” but I can obviously see that the clear sticker had been moved from original position since there’s is the residue from the past sticker. Could be a new one, could not be."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker so far,5,"Love this speaker so far.  Great sound, and a perfect balance between volume and size.  Good battery life.  Don't have to worry about covering it quick if it starts raining.  I need to find a better way to stick it in a bottle holder on my bike.  Zip tied to the frame at the moment, which works great, but a little bit of a hassle to remove to recharge or to use it elsewhere."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No need to spend 100’s of dollars!,5,Great sound and so easy to use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 Review,5,"The sound quality is astronomical, I really love it. Very easy to setup to your Bluetooth and once you charge it, the battery last for several hours."

If you are looking for a small speaker, you will love this one.  The only thing that is annoying (and why 4 stars instead of 5), is the tiny battery life!  You gave to charge it constantly!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,I’ve had four previous Bluetooth speakers.  They were literally garbage compared to this.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great outdoor speaker!!,5,"I purchased 2 JBL Flip 4 speakers....they paired very easily and I get to listen to music outside anywhere!!! You just move them where you want them...No wires, no electrical plug in!!!! Awesome!!!! Anywhere!!!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker but not as loud as I hoped for,3,"I was really excited to buy this speaker for my husband because I read so many good reviews about how loud it was. I have other Bluetooth speakers that are a lot less expensive, and this does not sound that much louder than them. I got this so that we could use it when we have company over,  but it is simply not loud enough to use in a room full of people. It’s fine if it’s just me and my husband and my son. The cool feature is that it’s waterproof and pretty durable, so I’m planning on bringing it to the beach this summer. So overall it’s a nice speaker, just not as loud as I had hoped for."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"Awesome sound quality, can be hear throughout your home, backyard and perfect size!"

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a really great A quality portable Bluetooth speaker. It’s worth every penny!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money.,5,Very happy with the overall sound of this item.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",aux in - completely unusable,1,"When given input via the aux in port the speaker skips intermittently.This was tested side by side with the exact same input on two different devices, plays fine on the other speakers.I don't know if you've tried to listen to music that intermittently skips, but it could be used as a form or torture, its far worse than no music at all.  This was purchased to go in my kids room as a speaker that we could either connect to via bluetooth or use a chromecast audio to feed it music via phones/google home.  It is quite literally worse than having nothing at all... if I could tape an aux jack to my desk lamp it would be equally functional and less annoying.Don't buy if you're looking to use it.  Aside from that the bluetooth connectivity seemed fine.I'm now going to look and see what my options are for returning this thing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great lil speaker,5,This came very fast two days stoked about that thank you! It came fully charged so I was able to blast my music while I worked today. This speaker is smaller but just as loud if not louder than the JBL3 older model. The volume of sound doesn't distort the music like most other small speakers do. I'm very happy with the JBL4 great speaker that I would purchase again!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,Sounds amazing and connects really quickly!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Bluetooth Speaker for travel,5,"This speaker sounds awesome for its size... actually sounds great for a speaker much larger. Great for travel, I carry it a lot in my saddlebags on my motorcycle. Never needed to bring the charging cable because battery life is really extraordinary for a speaker of this type. Great quality and value for your money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever,5,Better than any beats speaker I’ve ever known. It’s loud. Easy to travel with.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","New ""Connect+"" technology does not work.",3,"I just got two new Flip 4 units. They both produce excellent sound quality. Both will pair flawlessly via Bluetooth with my Windows 10 PC, separately-- but two speakers will not play at the same time from the same sound source. JBL advertises that, ""JBL Connect+ technology ... can wirelessly link more than 100 JBL Connect+ enabled speakers together..."" That is a false advertising statement! Buy one unit if you just want great sound quality. But do not buy two or more units, thinking that you can play the same sound signal, simultaneously and in synch, from one speaker in, say, the living room and one speaker in another room. The JBL Connect+ technology will NOT wirelessly link two or more JBL Connect+ enabled speakers together."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT Sound,5,Great sound! Safe to take while kayaking. Love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This has the beats!!,5,"So perfect to take anywhere.  Awesome sounds and the beats are amazing.  Waterproof, small enough to fit in a purse or backpack, Bluetooth and long live for the battery.  I love this and take it everywhere!  Great price too!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",good product,5,"good sound, easy to connect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The worst,1,It doesn't hold charge. The only way to play music is to keep it plugged in. I got this in February and now I can't even return it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Enjoy!!!,5,"It fits in the cup holder of my golf cart,  hangs on the side of my beach cart or sits on my front porch table playing anything from the classics, to nirvana or to those OutKast from south ATL.  Will play all day,  great sound,  would give more than 5 stars if I could!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good price,5,I like this jbl... cost a lot more in stores near me but amazon sells if for less
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,"It’s been awesome, I had an older Bose portable speaker and for the price you cannot go wrong."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s really worth buying a JBL Flip 4.,4,We love the quality sound and it’s portable.  We enjoy using this speaker at home and taking it out when we get together with friends and family.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speakers,4,"Overall, if you’re looking for a loud, great speaker, this is the best speaker for the money. The battery drains out and doesn’t really last 12 hours exactly, but it’s very portable and very minimalist in design which I love. Came in such a beautiful box!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it!,5,"The JBL flip is the best sounding bluetooth speaker I've ever heard. I got my first one for Christmas and loved it so much I bought a second one for stereo and for more versatility. The two together is simply an amazing combo. I truly couldn't be happier with the sound, the looks, the design and the functionality. Buy two!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,Super loud last forever have not had to charge yet it's perfect size

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome Speaker for the size and money!,5,"Super easy to connect, has awesome sound for its size, and has exceptional battery life! Lasts longer than what my original beats pill ever did. I also have the clip version by JBL and it’s just as outstanding! Great Company!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just what I was looking for,5,I was looking for something to replace the way we were listening to music while in the pool.This speaker does a really good job without spending a lot of money.The tone and clarity is really good and the volume is more than what I need.In my opinion this is a tremendous value and a good buy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound quality is really good for its size,5,"This is an impressive little speaker. The sound quality is really good for its size, with a surprising amount of bass. It paired quickly with my phone and connects right up as soon as I switch on the power. Battery life is also very good. Haven't tried the speaker phone feature yet, so I can't comment on that. It's compact enough to fit into a suitcase or backpack. Perfect for long weekend road trips. A winner."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for a classroom,5,"I purchased this for use in a classroom and the sound quality for that application is excellent. It also sounds great in my home.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life and clean sound .,5,Solid bass and sound.  Battery life excellent.  Perfect for my needs
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great size,5,I got this as a gift for my little brother. He was always asking to use my JBL Charge3 and figured getting his own would be great. I decided on this one because it was smaller and more practical. He loves it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love my jbl speaker it’s awesome,5,Carry around it’s awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little machine with loud sounds,5,"This JBL speaker really surprised me.. I knew that the music would sound fantastic but I didn't realize it would sound this clear. I played a video from YouTube and the sound is so clear and clean. This Bluetooth speaker is really worth every cent. So if anyone is thinking about purchasing this, don't think twice, just buy it. It's worth it~!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Awesome speakers, glad I chose these",5,"Love these... Ordered 2. They work perfectly, great sound, easy connect, long battery life. They connect together and 2 people on separate phones can control the music being played."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GREAT SPEAKER!,5,"I'm VERY pleased with this speaker. It surpasses my Bose Soundlink Mini II & my Sony SR30. More volume, great undistorted bass & treble in classical, classic rock, hard rock, & blues. The Sony & Bose were acceptable but died in under a year. I am hoping to have better longevity with this JBL."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery lasts 20 minutes,3,"Ordered this product in June 2018, it's now January 2019. And the battery can no longer hold its charge longer than 20 minutes. At first it would last for at least 12 hours but now I had to be plugged in to last that long. Also the plug has to be in the exact right spot for it to charge, if you bump it or jostle it in anyway, it stops charging. VERY frustrating.The Good:It is waterproof, (used it in the pool a few times). The sound quality is pretty good and the ability to use it to do conference calls (because it has a mic in it) is pretty awesome."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth speaker,5,Works like a champ

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Love this speaker! Plays long and sound great! Perfect size!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WHY!!!! $10.99 MORE,5,"I order the JBL FLIP 4 BLUETOOTH SPEAKER, BUT YOU CHARGE ME FOR THE JBL FLIP 5... WHY THE $10.99 more"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect!,5,Loud and durable. Small package big sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best bang for your buck,5,"This is probably the best speaker I've owned especially for 79 bucks. It's perfect for the river, beach, camping, pool side or at home. Lots of bass, volume is very loud."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than I ever expected,5,"Incredible Sound! Better than I ever expected. I was expecting something that would play music, but not much more. Based on other reviews, I purchased this one. It connects with no difficulty, and the sound is unbelievable. I'm considering buying another, because it can connect with other JBL speakers. The only thing I don't like is that it comes with a USB cable only - not a wall charger."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,Only used it a couple of times but it sounds great. Volume good. Connectivity good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A great buy!,5,"Had this item for awhile now. And I can say that I’m really happy with the purchase. It’s loud enough to play in your room and good to blast in a big bay like the one I work at. The battery life is about 3 hours tho, with it being at its loudest."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's a JBL....,5,"I've had JBL speakers for decades and this blue-tooth compact speaker lives up to JBL reputation.

This is one great speaker and battery quality/life has been excellent so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Es Perfecto,5,"Es perfecto para lo que estaba buscando, tiene un volumen muy alto !Gracias"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,This speaker is just as advertised.  Highly recommend!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker functions as expected,4,"Mostly this has been a great purchase and meets expectation especially for the price point, the only downside is that it has no flat edge so it is difficult to set it down and get even, full  sound out of it. Thus the 4 star rating."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome for price,5,"This has a beautiful sound, hooks quickly via bluetooth. I like that it's very sturdy and don't worry about it breaking falling over."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I use it daily at home with my smart phone? and on long trips in the car,5,"I didn't realize how much I would use one of these until I purchased it. I use it daily at home with my smart phone? and on long trips in the car. The stereo in the car isn't that loud and this compensates for it. I have 4 different music apps, including Amazon Music that pair wonderfully. I've gone from component systems to this and am extremely happy. I cannot quantify my happiness for this product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow!,5,"As soon as I turn it on it immediately connects to my phones Bluetooth. The battery lasts for weeks for me. And the sound... Oh, the sound. I was shocked at the depth and clarity that this little thing produces. Absolutely stunning. Deep bass, crisp highs, and clear mids. Everything you could ask for in a speaker this size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overall good product and value,4,Overall nice product for the price. Sleek and attractive design.  Bluetooth is fairly easy to install. Wish it had more buttons and control of music selection.  Love that it is waterproof. Wish it came with its own charger. Would buy again!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Made me a believer,5,I’ve only used Bose speakers. This one was ordered on a whim & I’m sold! Great sound quality & holds charge for a long time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absoluetly worth it.,5,"It's a nice size, shape and the sound really is much better than I expected.  The multi-pairing aspect is really pretty awesome.  Other reviews can state all of these in much greater detail, but the long and short of it - buy it if you need a nice long lasting portable speaker that you will enjoy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",All about that bass,5,This tiny speaker is incredible! A co-worker pulled one out when our sound system crashed and I was amazed at how full the sound was. Bluetooth connectivity is easy and the signal is strong allowing me to take my phone from room to room without static. Highly recommend this product if you’re looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker with quality sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,"Great sound, great battery life, great price. If you’re deciding between this & the Bose Soundlink Color, buy this. My only complaint about this speaker is that the lowest volume setting is not as low as I would have liked, but I would still buy it again in a heartbeat."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love,5,I bought this for my daughter’s birthday she loves it!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!,5,"I love this speaker, Amazon, and America! Stop wasting time and make the purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for the price!,5,My husband took this speaker on a 12 mile float trip and it ended up being completely submerged for a good part of the trip. It still works amazingly. It holds a charge well and still sounds great.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and waterproof,5,I have used this Flip 4 for years ever day. It has great sound quality and water proof. The color is perfect also.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,Powerful sound from this JBL Flip 4. When I listen to music I have to make sure that the volume is not too loud so as not to disturb others because this portable Bluetooth device is strong. This device is great for small gatherings or just listening to music while making dinner. I am very happy with this Bluetooth device and I would purchase it again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy with this,5,This is a surprisingly powerful little speaker. Very happy with this. Simple to set up. Great to add a second speaker for 'stereo or party mode'. Press of a button and two speakers wirelessly connect to create surround sound. Awesome. Can link many of these and I am looking to add more.Purchased the white and blue for teenage daughters. They love the fact that they can keep by the pool and not worry about getting wet.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker.,5,It’s really awesome. Just one minor problem it’s the battery life. Sometimes it would last 3 day’s with small uses or only like 6 hr if running without break. But it might be me trippin. Other than that it’s loud and the bass is real dope.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound!,5,Works perfectly! Fantastic sound quality. Total bargain! Love it! Delivered quickly.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Sound!,5,The sound is amazing! Love how crisp and clear this is. I have a white desk ascetic and it just adds to the vision! I Order the red as well to pair for surround sound movie watching ;)
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality,4,The speaker sounds good. The battery life is excellent.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It’s a beast! Best bang for the buck, definitely get a carrying case though.",5,The Price and Quality are spot on!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",the best100 bucks I have ever spent,5,after reading all of the reviews i selected this one despite the higher costI could not be happier with my decisionthe blue tooth connection is fantasticthank you
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and little size.,5,These speakers are awesome!  Compact with great sound.  Perfect for the pool deck.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds Very Good,4,"This speaker is easy to use and sounds great, particularly given its small size.  My only concern is that the speakers are exposed and are quite delicate.  It is not appropriate for some one who isn't willing and able to take care of it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker,5,I have had the speaker for a little over 4 weeks and It sounded great right out of the box. No problems so far.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery ??,5,"Sounds great, just wish battery would last longer"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My mom loves it,5,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom! The only reason I gave the sound quality, battery life, and bluetooth connectivity four stars is because I haven’t personally used the speaker. From what my mom tells me though, it’s a great sounding speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good product,5,My son loved it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best bang for the buck,5,Great speaker that we take to the beach and pair with our phone or pair on the patio at home with Alexa. The sound quality is awseome.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good,5,Big sound and good sound quality for the size. I've only had it a month or so but it exceeds expectations thus far.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Everything I wanted,5,Everything I wanted just like I said I’m happy with this purchase
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It was a graduation present for my grandson.,5,My grandson told me how much he likes it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super durable! We love it!,5,Super durable. Great battery life. We love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Will not charge,1,"Sounds great and great design, but I really wish it would charge and since it is not, It is useless and a one star item. From day one the speaker has not wanted to charge and play music at the same time and now, as of the past few days, It just simply will not charge, whether it is on or off. I plug it in for an hour or longer using the provided usb cord and an Amazon brand wall plug, since that is not provided, then I unplug it and it shows just one of the several lights for charge. Maybe it is defective, or maybe it is the plug I am using. If it actually came with a plug specifically for it, and they didn't just send the USB cord, then maybe this wouldn't be an issue at all. Either way, I am super annoyed at this device surprised that an an expensive brand name device such as this is giving me this trouble."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Well worth it.,5,Sound quality for the size is amazing. We love this thing and use it every day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Turning off after 15 minutes of use,3,"I’ve had this JBL for less than a year and it cannot go more than 15 minutes without shutting off on its own. Trust me, I’ll charge it every single night to make sure it has full power but something is wrong. It’s really frustrating being that I’ve had it less than a year because I thought the quality would be good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Excellent product, sound quality is great.",5,"Excellent product, sound quality is great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The product stop working. Very disappointed,3,The product stop working after I dropped it in the pool and now it’s they say it’s too late to turn in but I can’t get it to do nothing
"JBL Flip 4, Black",In love!?,5,I love everything about it. Bought light grey which blends with my buildins Sound is amazing for this price!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Boom,5,"I was not expecting such a boom of sound from this little speaker, quality product!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great!,5,I wish it had an automatic shutoff like my previous speaker. However it does have superior sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent audio quality for the size and price,5,"Wow, the sounds is significantly better than I had expected. Yes, I tried this speaker in some store before buying it, and it sounds much better at home when you eliminate the typical store surroundings not friendly to an audio listening experience.Almost all the time, audio is streamed from an iPhone to this device; I have not used any other input[, yet]"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound,5,Its small but puts out big sound and its clear
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lasted 8 Months....,2,"Let me start by explaining I used this sparingly over the 8 months. Mostly to trips overseas, poolside. At first, it was a really cool joke to pull on people.....(Sir/Maam, can you hold this for me, then drop it ""accidentally"" into the pool and watching people's faces during and after I pull it out of the water. Absolutely hilarious.)However, on my last trip I packed it in my carry on, and never used it. Took it out and tried to use it over labor day weekend.....to find it completely dead. I mean, I literally could not have used it more than 30 times. I think it maybe the battery may have been faulty. I am in the process of RMA'ing this but I am completely annoyed that I have to go through the hassle.Overall, I WAS so happy with this item. Sound was great. Clear, and really loud, no distortion. Great Balance (I'm a bit of an audiofile). Material was solid. Heavy. Also beautiful (had mine in white).Would I buy it again? I mean...maybe if it would last. The sound is so worth the cost. Being waterproof makes it even better. So possibly but I am more inclined to try out the competition first."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressed by the sound of this thing,5,"I admit, I'm old.  My stereo speakers from decades back come up to my hip.  That this tiny thing can produce such sound truly amazes me.  It's much better than the sound bar we have for our TV, more crystalline high notes, less muddiness.I've put three stars on the battery because I don't know on that yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4,5,Same day delivery is awesome! Received the product in 7 hrs after putting in my order.  JBL packaging A+.  This thing is small fits perfect in my bug out bag for work.  Got the camo the whole thing is solid very well made.  The sound is premium compare to other Bluetooth speakers.  I'm happy and satisfied with this purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker but product dimensions are incorrect,4,"Great product, and it sounds great. As others mentioned - I wish it had more base. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the product dimensions say 3.6"" x 8.5"" but it's 3"" x 6.75"" and I ordered a larger case based on the dimensions stated in the details ... which I now have to return. :-("
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Speaker!,5,Works great with iPhone or Computer.  Excellent sound quality.  The bass really rocks!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE THIS SPEAKER,5,LOVE THIS SPEAKER!! I have a Bose Soundlink that just wasn't cutting it and bought the JBL Flip 4 as a replacement. The Bose battery was already failing and just simply wasn't loud enough. The JBL is plenty loud enough and battery charges fast and is very long lasting. The JBL Flip 4 does not carry bass like the Bose but can still hold it's own.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wort the price,5,"Sound is great, battery lasts longer than I expected. Use it everyday"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",sound quality,5,"Great sound, convenient to take anywhere and easliy connects to bluetooth"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love the new speaker,5,We love our new speaker. Would purchase again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth Speaker,4,"Excellent sound quality & volume, sturdy & durable design, great battery life.  Have had issue with certain iPhone X not being able to connect - and occasionally loses connectivity unexpectedly and must be restarted."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,I had one before and ended up losing it so I upgraded to a 4. I think I like it more! Sounds great and battery last long enough for me!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,"I love everything about this!I dont use it for music but to make conference calls, and the sound is superb!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bien buen  sonido,5,"Buena conectividad Bluetooth, sonido bueno"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This by far is the the Best Bluetooth speaker in this price range I have ever ...,5,"I have tried quite a few Bluetooth speakers including Bose Soundlink Mini, Phillips Shockbox, and some of the Sony to name a few and none compare to the Flip 4.  This by far is the the Best Bluetooth speaker in this price range I have ever listened to. The clarity of the highs is incredible, the mids not overbearing and the bass response is rich and full.  In addition, The Flip 4 is so incredibly mobile.  You won't be disappointed!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speakers. Would buy again.,5,"This product impressed me. Initially uncertain about the sound quality, when we placed it on a high shelf in the room, the sound carries through the whole room nicely. I am not a sound expert but I listen to a lot of music - all ranges seem to be well covered and the base is fairly good too. Best speakers under $100 I've ever owned, and I look forward to travelling with them!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome as usual,5,Great speakers!  Buy more than one and link them together for more sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A MUST HAVE SPEAKER,5,JBL speaker is even more beautiful in person than in the picture. Immaculate quality for sound as well as battery & Bluetooth connectivity!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bought 3,5,Love it want the big one too pricey right now
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great battery, easy portability",5,"I have the larger version of this and purchased this as a gift for my younger brother as a high school graduation gift. He loves it and uses it all the time. Perfect for good sound in small spaces such as dorm rooms, but also powerful and portable enough to take to a small house party."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, very portable",5,"Bought it as Christmas gift for our son, but several members of the family like it so much that we keep borrowing it!Very portable with tremendous sound. Will get alot of use this summer around the pool area and when playing sports with friends."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",All around great speaker,5,"Great sound quality, great battery life, and love that it is waterproof!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",easy to use,5,I have only used this twice but so far am very happy with it. It is smaller than I thought it was but I like it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Thanks!,5,"Very nice, well worth the money. Thanks Amazon for the discount!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Even better than expected!,5,"What an awesome and powerful little speaker. Fully recommended, even over the Charge 3. Both the clarity and bass are on point. The louder you play the music, the better it sounds with no distortion ever. I bring this thing everywhere with me and people love it. Even at the beach, with wide open space and ambient noise around, it explodes with sound and you can clearly hear and ""feel"" the bass. Way cool. Thanks Jbl!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",But same JBL speaker for stereo play,4,Note that flip four and flipped three do not synchronize for multiply you have to buy the same item
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,Awesome!!!!! The bass is amazing! I love it..I'll repeat review in 6 months.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life isn’t the best. It’s not as loud as bose.,5,I love the white!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,This speaker sounds as good as or even better then my Bose speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Totally recommended,5,A small and powerful speaker. I love JBL they sound amazing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Treble Too Harsh at Medium to High Volumes,3,"I listen to Jazz that has deep base and high horns. I find that when I turned the volume up loud enough to hear the bass, the horns sound harsh. When I turn the volume down to make the horns listenable, the bass goes away. There is a sweet spot in which the bass and treble sound ok, but too quiet to be enjoyable to me. Plus, the speaker is designed not to roll backward, but there is nothing preventing the speaker from rolling forward. Ergo, when I put the Flip 4 on the dashboard of my car, the Flip 4 rolls off the dash when I accelerate. Had to send it back.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect little speaker,5,Bought this to bring down to the lake for a girls day where we didn't have access to electricity. The battery lasted ALL day and the sound was great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for a small speaker,5,"Sound is amazing and rich and loud for a little speaker like this.  However, it is not discoverable by my ipad mini 5."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great,4,nice
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works,5,"Works as advertised.  Cheap, sounds good. What else can you ask?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,5,Got this for 49.99 on a lightning deal. It's legit nice sound and bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good speaker,5,Nice sound battery’s life good worth having for out side for back grounds Music
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fits perfect and is of high quality material,5,Came quickly and it fits perfectly!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great value,5,I love it it is everything a promised to be. Great value.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",GOOD QUALITY SPEAKER,5,LOVE MY JBL SPEAKERSOUNDS GOOD AND EXCELLENT AS EXPECTED
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,I bought for myv16 old daughter. Sounds great. Said it loud. Lasts a while. Easy to connect 2 Bluetooth.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it.. He uses it all the time in the shower and just listening around the house. The sound of that small box pack a loud sound.. He was shocked when he heard that.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",For whatever reason the speaker does not work well with Spotify or any other it works with,5,Works well good sound clarity
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wonderful sound!!,5,Best Bluetooth speaker! Better than Bose
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent speaker,5,"Have been using the speaker for about 3 weeks now and it is great. Sound quality is impressive for such a small speaker. And the shape is ideal, similar to the size of a soda can, allowing it to fit well in cup holders. Very happy with this product. And the battery last a long time as well."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product.,5,Satisfied with my purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My son-in-law had one so I liked it,5,It has good sound for a small speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent sound & value,4,"Excellent valued portable speaker.  Yes, there are speakers that may have better bass, but their cost is much higher.  If you want a portable speaker with very good sound, is water proof and easy to use, then seriously consider this JBL speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!!,5,My mom loves her new speaker glad I bought it for her!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It is am awesome speaker.,5,"THIS SPEAKER IS FRICKING AWESOME. It favors bass sounds just a bit, but it is great, loud enough without distorting the sound. Would buy 10 more just because. I gave one to each of my kids. I also own the charge 4, this once sounds better."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound small package,5,Safe for by the pool
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Used JBL Passed Off As New,1,"My rating is a reflection on my experience with the seller, not on the product itself bc I love the JBl Flip 4 — great sound even by 2022 standards and a rugged, compact, waterproof construction. When I saw that the speaker could still be had, brand new apparently, I jumped at the chance. And I loved the design too. Well, it was too good to be true. The sketchy seller (1on1) sent a scuzzy, obviously used product instead. I promptly sent it back. Don’t waste your time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect little speaker,5,"Love this speaker. Went through two Oonzt Angles before I decided to try JBL. Sound quality is superior in every way and the music, no matter how loud, doesn't vibrate the speaker like the Oonzt did."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, battery not so great",3,"For such a small speaker it sounds great, quality seemed great but I got 1- 1/2 years out of it, now it won't charge anymore. Thought I'd get a few more years out of it than that since it was a JBL but, I guess not this one."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful,5,This is sturdy and emits great sound quality!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, bad battery",5,"Love the sound quality,battery is trash and doesn't last long. Still worth the money."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Girlfriend Loves it.,5,Bought it as a gift and she loves it. Can even here it in other rooms while she's getting ready.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You won’t be disappointed!,5,Bought it for my mom as a present and she loves it! Says the sound is very quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good.,4,For such a small speaker it sounds good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty good,4,Good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What others think about the product?,4,I like the product and it works very nice.  I just wish the sound could be a little louder since I use it for my class at the university I am a faculty.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Easy connection, great sound, life of the party."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable speaker!,5,"There's not much not to like here! It's small & convenient to carry anywhere, has great sound including bass and the battery lasts quite a while! Wish I had gotten it sooner!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good. Easy to pair and the sound is very ...,5,"So far so good.  Easy to pair and the sound is very good for it's size.  It's generally loud enough for most of my needs at work.  I wish the clarity was a little better at high volumes but really no real complaints to speak of.  For the price and the size, I believe this is an excellent product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Second one was the right one,4,The first one I ordered did not charge. Returned and got a second one that works perfect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Highly recommend!,5,"This is my second JBL purchase and I am so happy with the products. It has a wonderful sound quality for the size. Also, it is truly waterproof -- it has been splashed and submerged in water and has not impacted the quality of the product at all."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, especially for our doors!",5,This speaker is amazing! The sound is wonderful for large areas.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality portable speaker. Low volume will last multiple days,5,great product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,Love this speaker. I already have one for myself and ended up buying another for a gift. You can completely submerge the speaker in water and it still works... great for outdoor summer activities. Puts out great sound and is half the price of Bose speakers. Highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Both of my JBL from this seller are defective,1,"I have purchased 2 JBL and both are defective.I have sent a message but didn’t get return. I usually purchase several educational items from Amazon for my school in Brazil. When I got back to Brazil and tested the items we quickly realized it was defective.We took it to an authorized place to fix and they have assured that the charging plug and the battery is defective.To fix it, is more expensive than purchasing a new one from a reliable store such as Best Buy.The picture is showing a product that I just pulled from the box. Notice it doesn’t chargeConclusion. One JBL worked for a day and the other JBL never worked."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best Waterproof Speaker!,5,Best little speaker I ever owned hands down. Good bass and very clear sound. We bought it for the beach and had it in the water with us. Battery would last most of the day. Never had an issue of it dying on us on our day trips at the beach. Easy to connect to also. Fully recommend this lil guy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommended,5,"It sound perfect , and the battery life is incredible"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Needs to be close to bluetooth device,5,Reallybloke the sound if not turned up to loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",battery life is great,5,battery life is great plenty loud for the golf course
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,4,Great speaker. A little pricey but it’s nice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality speaker for the money,5,Everything good so far...
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this speaker,5,The absolute best portable Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever bought.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",... no speaker expert but me and my family are happy with it,5,"I'm no speaker expert but me and my family are happy with it. I use it on my bedroom, our classroom during breaks and even on poolside. It gives the same quality of sound with that punchy base whether indoor or outdoor. You'll be able to distinguish the mids, highs and lows.. it is compact and the rugged finish protects itself from bumps and drops. Battery lasts about 2 days with 6hours per day on 75% volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,"Excellent sound for a small device, easy to set up connection. Don't know about battery life yet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So nice!,5,The best speaker I have ever had!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!,5,Just what we needed for outside use!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not cheap but worth it,5,Great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, ability to sync with other units",5,Several members of the family have bought these. Love that they can all be synced together to provide great surround sound around the pool or campsite. Sound quality is excellent.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker ! ! !,5,"This was great! I do not regret buying this speaker at all. I was a bit torn though between both reviews positive and negative. But yes if you put the speaker at it’s highest level of volume yes the battery does die faster. But if you can look past that part then awesome, you got yourself a great portable speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy,5,"Good sound and battery, easy to carry around"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy. Loud enough plus other features,5,This is top quality.They said the battery lasts 16 hours. I find that hard to believe. It needs a constant source of power hooked into it for that to be true.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressive for its Price and Size,5,"Great for it's size especially since it is under 100 dollars. At first the bass was overwhelming so the speaker didn't sound good but after a couple songs at max volume it sounds very very good. Bass is good but not great, but that is expected due to its size. Overwall I am impressed that JBL can make a great sounding speaker for an affordable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",If you love music then must have personal speaker.,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Crystal clear  with JBL signature sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this speaker!!!!,5,This is a great speaker. Very happy with my purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not the best or the worst,3,"Bought this speaker about two years ago and for about 6 months it was perfect. Then the charger broke and it can only charge @ a certain angle. It's also not very ""sand proof"". i've taken it to the beach multiple times and you can now here sand inside of the speaker when music is played. I recently actually lost the speaker at the beach, it would be nice if they came with a tracking device in them that's connected to the app. Other than that the speaker is decent quality, definitely ""water proff"" and the sound quality is nice. Still disappointed I lost it and cant find it :("
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best quality,5,Very good sound and great volume
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Es Genial!!,5,"Muy buena , la batería dura mucho y buena calidad de audio."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really good for light jazz music and vocals,5,I'm an audiophile myself where quality matters and I was a bit impressed by the size of the speaker and the quality it had. There's definitely slight boost on those around 100 to 150 hertz freq and it just drops off after that but really nice auto eq for what the speaker excells in which are distinct mids and clear highs.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,Has really good sound. Worth the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works well... Sounds nice...,5,It works very well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and quality,5,Love the string sound and great quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality!,5,"For the price I'm really happy with my purchase, it definitely packs a punch and it's proven to be durable. I've used it in many occasions, dropped it a few times and have submerged it under water about 5 times so far. Can't go wrong with JBL, it felt right to spent a few more dollars for a quality product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,I don’t know why there are so many bad reviews on this product but since had only good experiences. It works perfectly. It’s loud. The battery last a while I’m not constantly plugging it in. I bought the warranty just in case tho.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,This little speaker is AMAZING! My friend had one on her boat so I went on Amazon and ordered myself one!!  Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Holds a charge well,5,Use it sitting out on our back deck
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,Great speaker. I had been wanting it for a long time and didn’t want to spend that much. Prime day came around and I couldn’t pass it up. I’m very happy with the sound quality and by the volume. We use it outside around our pool and we can hear it crisp and clear.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",5 star all the way!!!,5,Love the great sound!  The portability and ease of use!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,It was a winner from the start. I have had other systems in the past. The all around quality of this system surpasses all of the rest by far!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,"It’s perfect for working out, or working in the backyard"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","It plays great music all the time ,with great sound",5,"I liked it very much it works great ,thank you to Amazon."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great value, excellent sound, easy set up.",5,"This speaker sounds great, and is way louder than most of us need for daily use. It connects to my iPhone easily and is compatible. I don’t struggle at all, I never read any instructions, very much just took out of the box and was all set. Very good bass, sounds equally great with music or podcasts. Excellent value."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surprisingly good.,5,"For context, it's 01:06, and my house may smell as if a skunk peeked in for a minute.While enjoying a midnight snack and listening to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" from the [i]Across the Universe[i] film soundtrack. Everything was sounding great, and then I heard a bullet. It may have been artificial, but I swear, I heard a friggin' bullet. I was half a gulp from choking at the jump-scare."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Unique shape,3,The speakers have a good bass effect and the treble effect is not very good.  The speaker shape is still ok
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,Sounds beautiful and battery life lasts long time
"JBL Flip 4, Black",BRILLIANT!!!!,5,"Incredible sound quality from just one — but pair it with a second one and be prepared to be blown away!!!  Sounds like a system costing thousands. Almost like being at a rock concert!  So easy to pair together and with an iPhone — unlike another brand I tried first.  They fill a room with clear, crisp, bright sound. Great bass from such a small size. Stunningly brilliant!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,I love the  sound quality !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!,5,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I have one myself, and he liked mine so much that he wanted one! These JBL speakers are always really good quality. It arrived quickly and in good condition! I ordered him the ocean blue color, and it is SO PRETTY in person! I wish mine was this color now too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Came without charger,4,I have always been a fan of JBL products and this product seems to meet expectations. Excellent sound quality and enough sound distribution for my use. Came without a charger cable though which is why my overall rating is only 4 stars
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good deal,5,"Nice little speaker, it has a good bass for the small size"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",all I can say is don't waste your time and money on the much more expensive ...,5,"Bough this along with the Bose SoundLink 2 Bluetooth to test side by side. After listened to both, all I can say is don't waste your time and money on the much more expensive Bose speaker. What's a disappointment, the JBL Flip 4 was by far a superior phone compare to the Bose in sound all around. The Bose with max volume on can barely be heard from 12 feet away and base just too weak."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This little speaker is impressive,5,"Hands down the best sound of any speaker in this price range. Trust me I physically tested them all, watched the YouTube videos, etc.I traveled w the flip 3 for a year and it was awesome having it. I lost it and wanted to see if anything better, but as I mentioned after testing them all I went to the flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and quality!,5,"Love it. Outstanding for out by the pool, on the deck, beach or in the gym working out (I have my own gym)."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,5,I use this speaker almost every day when I'm in the shower or at work great sound quality and the battery life is great!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,I like the price. And the overall quality of the product.  I don't like that it doesn't automatically shut off after no use after 15 mins or so.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound but battery is a known issue.,3,"First of all the JBL Flip 4 sounds great, no doubts. Unfortunately the unit has a bad battery that dies shortly after a couple of months. First you will start noticing the battery last less than usual, then it takes longer to 'fully charge'. Mine started this way, now it's useless, it can take several hours to supposedly show fully charged and it may work for 15min before dying.Warranty? I've never heard anybody was granted a replacement.You need to get an aftermarket battery and replace it by yourself.Is it worth it? Yes it is, in my opinion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound quality!,5,Sounds great! Love how clear it sounds. Haven't tried using it on a call as yet but I will eventually and update. Overall really happy with my purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works!,5,Great blue tooth speaker.  I keep it in my golf bag for when I play a round.  Runs easily 10 hours on one charge and sounds good.  I also like the function of being able to play from one phone out of multiple JBL devices.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Speaker,5,The sound out of this little speaker is amazing. Once I heard it bought one for my 79 year old parents who use it on their boat and my son who uses it in his room. Wow is it loud and the sound is fantastic. One of the best mobile speakers I've ever heard.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,The sound is awesome and for a small speaker it very loud.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best BT Speaker Ever,5,"Best speaker ever. So worth the spend. Spent years going through crappy $25 Bluetooth speakers that would last a few months and never sounded truly great.JBL is the polar opposite. Great construction, feels durable.Sound is great. We use this pool side regularly. Loud enough for us, doesn't feel pushed too hard when the volume is cranked.Definitely worth it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This thing is awesome.,5,"First of all this thing is awesome, I love it, it has awesome sound, easy too use and set up, crisp clear sound and that bass tho, I had the flip 3 and I kicked my self in the behind for selling it, been looking for one every since, I finally got this one and its so much better, for the price you cant complain its worth it"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound for small price,5,WOW!! Fell in love as soon as i used it. Sound is awesome . Price is great. Definitely recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small size Big Sound,5,"I originally thought this was the bigger version so I was surprised when I opened the box and it was small. However, after playing music through it I was surprised of how loud it got with great sound quality. I only wish there was little bit more lower bass in the speakers but overall I'm pretty happy."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great choice,5,Great purchase. Lasts super long and works well. Have to buy another bc my kids keep stealing.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its important to know i appreciate amazon the way they makeon line stuffs easier,4,I like the sound of it and i use it in my bedroom to listen to  music while i fall a sleep music is like medicine to me!.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is not as represented,3,"Great speaker BUT forget about the 12 hour battery life they show. Full charge first play lasted barely 4 hrs. Tempted to return it, but the sound is so good I may just live with the short battery life. I'm disappointed in JBL."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,I love this item that I now have 2 of them!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome sound from such a small speaker,4,Only complaint is it claims to last 12 hours on a full charge and I'm not seeing that. Even at half to 2/3 volume I'm probably closer to 8 or 9 hours. Still very happy worth it but it claims 12 hours so I had to point that out
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for connecting several Flip 4s,5,"The Flip 4s are great for using them in multiple rooms or outside. I was contemplating the purchase of a flip 5 but the flip 5 is not compatible with the flip 4 in a multi-speaker environment. Sorry JBL, you messed up  here."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best in home speaker,5,I love this speaker. I use it whenever we have friends or family over and we need some background music while everyone is mingling or enjoying a meal. I have no complaints. Great loud speaker and battery life is amazing!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speakers,5,Good speakers for the price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Bluetooth speaker for a reasonable price!,5,All I can say is that this affordable Bluetooth speaker is amazingly loud with a strong bass for it's size.

Will be buying more JBL products!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic speakers,5,"I gave this product five stars and it really deserves it, it gets very loud and the sound quality is superb on this speaker, the bass is very noticeable even on high volume.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolute value,5,Very clear and clean at moderate volume.  Sound kind of flattens out at high volume but that level is irritatingly high.  Will fill your den and kitchen with tunes that are clear and crisp.  Great value buy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Flip 4 with a pleasing modeling and color.,5,"I have a pair of JBL Flips 4.every time Connect them and set them to Stereo Mode in the iOS App. Music is always full of power and lifelike surrounded in space...If it only needs to be set once (stereo mode) instead of doing the same setting action every time, this is really great!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",BETTER THAN THE BEATS PILL,5,"NEVER give 5 star reviews. I had to for this new speaker from JBL. Amazing battery life at 12 hours. Sleek design almost mimicking the Beats Pill, but in my opinion way better looking. The Bluetooth range is insane I can go across my yard with my phone in my pocket which is like 70-80 ft from where I place the speaker and it doesn't lose connection. scoop one up before they're all gone."

These JBL portable speakers get all sorts of glowing reviews but it honestly sounds just ok. It works, sounds ok, and is not too expensive, so its ok. I don't regret the purchase. Any review that says that this thing is blasting out crystal clear sound though is just looking to get a few cents from the recommendation."

I really have nothing but good things to say about this speaker. Get one."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life is not even 2 hrs.,2,I bought this for my husband as his other one died. I bought this because of the claimed long battery life. Upon his initial charge he said it only lasted maybe 2 hours and since only works on the charger. Save your money.

I received it and it was in perfect condition, not even the slightest hint of a mark or scratch, and it works perfectly.

No complaints.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound,5,"Just opened up mine and the sound is absolutely amazing. So clear, great bass, just perfect. I can’t comment on the battery life because I just got it, but I am extremely happy with this speaker. I was going to go with a cheaper speaker and I’m glad I went with this!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The thing to know about this product is it sounds great. And it works well for entertaining.,4,"No true knowledge about battery. For me it was a unpack, plugged in and play.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Add as many as you want to your cluster. (Up to 100),5,"Love these speakers. I got two and will someday add more. They link together and can make for a very inexpensive whole house sound system. Want more volume? Add more devices. Bass is decent, but not super thumpy - size of space make a difference. In the bathroom, bass seems stronger, outside not so much. I plan to buy more."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPEAKER,5,"Love this speaker, use it all the time."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",excelente!!!,5,"bonita, suena super biennnn, de buena calidad"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE,5,I really like this speaker. The quality is great and the battery lasts a long time.  The bluetooth works great and I use it mostly to make sales calls without having to use a headset or ear buds and the quality is really good.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente,5,"Muy buena compra, excelente audio, y muy práctica para viajar.??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!!,5,The product is above and beyond our expectations. Was so pleased with it that I ordered another one a few days later. We plan to use them for our outdoor theater.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL is the best!,5,I Purchased it  as a gift for my friend. This device is really awesome. Sound quality is very satisfactory and the charge quality is awesome. Recommended product!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,These speakers are all amazing. You can’t go wrong
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality of product,5,This is an amazing sounding speaker for the price. The app was easy to load on phone and connectivity was awesome. I use outside and this little speaker really puts out the sound. Love the case to keep it in also.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL speaker,5,The sound is GREAT!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I’d buy it again,5,Love the sound quality for the price!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small but Big Sound!!,5,This is the second JBL speaker I have bought! We love these little speakers. They have a great sound quality and are easy to use. We have taken them to feb beach and used on a cruise.  I would highly recommend! Let me know if you found my review helpful!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,4,The speaker was actually smaller than I anticipated but it is quite powerful and has a great sound and clarity for such a small device.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Long battery charge,4,We enjoy these. Bought it several months ago and has performed well. It is a little confusing when you have two of them in the house but I think we have worked that out and have been able to pair them. The charge lasts a long time.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Quiet Bass, Short Battery Life, Bad App.",3,"This speaker is pretty good. Looks good, it can be loud, and its easy to use. There are a few problems though that are significant.1. The bass is hard to hear unless you're playing bass heavy songs. It needs to be like 50% louder.2. The advertised battery life is 12 hours, it's about half of that.3. JBL made an app called JBL connect. The app is terrible, it only works if you allow it access to your location. It is really buggy, its tutorials are extremely vague, and i couldn't get 2 speakers to play simultaneouly after about 20 minutes of trying."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love,5,This is a great speaker for the price. I love that I can have it in humid climates (including the shower) without the risk of damaging it (though purposefully putting it in and underwater is NOT suggested). It sounds great. I use it for about an hour a day and charge it about once a week. Love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good but the mic is broken,3,Sound quality is very good but I couldn't get the mic working with my computer. I called support and they said it was designed that way. It only works with a cell phone not with a computer. That's dumb. Why would you design something that's broken?
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound quality will surprise you,5,This speaker has great sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Really good, high quality audio for the price, loud for a small speaker, overall great product",5,I honestly use the thing 5-6 days out of the week. It’s great for blasting it full volume in the shower listening to Mötley Crüe and head banging with your buddies
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy. No regrets.,5,Bought this speaker for $80 and this is easily the best $80 I’ve spent. The sound quality is phenomenal and it gives out a great bass sound without vibrating the ground. The battery life of the speaker outlives my phone by about 5 times. I am very please with this product and will definitely buy another Flip 4 in near future.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doesn't last past a year.,2,"I’ve had this exact speaker for 2 years and I owned the 3 before. Both basic use, nothing crazy and neither of them touched water even though this one is water proof. Both of them stopped working properly after about a year. They start dying quickly and the sound becomes all scratchy and awful. Now the only way to use it is on low volume and charging, otherwise it dies within 10 minutes. I thought it was a bad egg thus why I upgraded it to this one. But obviously they don’t last long."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far so good.,5,Can't speak to battery life yet but sounds great with no distortion.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, Bluetooth connectivity to multiple devices slightly problematic",4,"The speaker is great, the bass and sounds are great especially for rooms/enclosed spaces, but it is a little heavy, and the Bluetooth connectivity doesn’t work well when several devices are on and have connected to the speaker before"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great bt speaker,5,Give great sound for calls and movies.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best  purchase I ever  made,5,"Excellent  sound guality,Bluetooth  connectivity and battery  life"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,4,"Absolutely love the sound this little speaker makes. Whether by the pool or in the garage this thing is great.My only gripe on it is the quality of the charging cord.As you can see by the pictures, it got stuck in the back and broke off."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL all day,5,JBL never fails: this is my second one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a must have.,5,The sound is amazing. Such a difference between the jbl flip 3

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Got here quickly and good product,5,"Great sound quality, and great battery life, so far...."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far I like it,4,I have a larger indoor speaker that doesn't work that well at low volume so I bought this one.Took it camping in the rain a couple weeks ago.Sounds nice. Perfect size. No bluetooth hassles.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Got what I paid for in a good way.,5,"Great sound for the money.  No, this is not high end sound but I was surprised at the bass this little speaker puts out.  If you want something portable, light weight and convenient I highly recommend this speaker.  Charges pretty quickly and holds the charge well.  I haven't timed it yet but haven't had an issue either."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds amazing for price,5,"I got this for my husband and he uses it constantly, and it sounds great. He loves listening to music. A great gift that did not disapoint, you can hear it all over the loft apartment from one place. Clear sound"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,Absolutely love it so much better then the speaker I previously had the sound quality is amazing and pretty much charged and Bluetooth connectivity was so easy definitely happy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker is very helpful and very nice,5,Very easy to connect and gets very loud and clear especially with two of them paired together
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product...for one year,3,"We take it with us biking and the sound quality is amazing when we are going through crowds. It's also small, light weight, and water proof so easy to take with you anywhere. Battery life wanes after one year. We had to replace after the first year bc it stopped charging. Our second one now has issues with the charger. I used to love JBL but I didn't realize that quality wasn't great for the long run. After 12 hours charging, it's on 4 bars (not 5) and we have to move the chord back and forth a lot for charger to stick."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,East to set up and great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound Quality ROCKS!,5,Using this item in my home and work office.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect sound and great to take with you everywhere !,5,This is simply amazing. After buying a few other speakers I can tell you this one works great whether it’s in the house or on a bike ride!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disappointing,2,"Used this speaker once and it was okay. Not blown away by sound quality. I just took it out to use a second time and the playback is full of static. I store it in a sealed plastic bin that just sits on a shelf (see picture), no way it could have been damaged. I have another one that I bought that we use a lot and still works fine, only thing is the syncing glitched when I tried to pair them together the first time I used them (only the one near my phone worked well, the other one was only one room away). Disappointing for the price I paid. Especially since one is useless now."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,Connected easily and it sounds great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",battery life,3,battery does not last nearly as long as advertised... bought fo a float trip and with a full charge it only lasted 3 hours into the float. very disappointed
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent SOUND!!,5,"What a great sounding speaker. Bought this for my daughters salon and it sounds like the music is coming out of the walls, crisp, clear with a nice base that makes it so comforting to listen to while pampering her clients. I would definitely recommend the JBL for any home or business and the price is right."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,4,"Runs less than the 12 time stated. Nice sound. Durable. I was going to buy a less expensive one, but glad I did not. Friends have the cheaper ones, but the sound quality doesn't compare"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,I LOVE this speaker!!! My father put me on to the brand and ever since then I've wanted one. I had an ION Room Rocker but I broke it after years of use and loud music lol. I hope I don't do the same with this one but this is better because it's portable. I've used it every day since the date of delivery??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for a small room.,4,"Great for a small room, but not in the car when competing with road noise.I"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth speaker!,5,A lot of bass from a small speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Love my speaker. Sounds real good and its very convenient to have around anywhere. Wether is being used while playing ball at the park or using it at the swimming pool or even at home while having a get together, it always get the  job done. Simple to connect and the battery on it lasts for a long time. Just have to buy another to try connecting them together which is an added feature."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker with big sound,5,Great sound and battery life!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",3 stars,4,Wasn't loud enough. Battery life was terrible
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good, not great",4,"Not enuf bass, but overall a good product. Battery doesnt last as long as id like, but not bad either."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,Speaker has a great tone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It works great!,5,I love this speaker! It is very loud when turned up all the way. We use it when we are having a bbq in our backyard.

"JBL Flip 4, Black","It is great, unless you want to connect 2 speakers",4,It's a great speaker buy when you connect 2 of the exact same model it stutters and sounds really bad even if they're a few steps away.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality,5,Easy to use. Great sound quality at high volume.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Rivals larger speakers,5,"The sound of this speaker blew me away. I threw a party and everyone thought I had a large system. When I showed them the speaker they were shocked. A couple people said they were going to buy their own. And I haven’t tried it yet, but the box says this speaker can be linked  with other JBL flip 4’s."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,5,Awesome little radio! The sound is amazing. Definately recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works as it should,5,Great Product.  Works as it should no issuse

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love this speaker,5,"Incredible sound and the favorite of portable speakers. There isnt a beach day that does not include this speaker. For the bbqs and hangouts, this brings the party alive with the amazing performance. Really great sounding highs and bass. Constantly complimented on it"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best Bluetooth speaker on the market with the best price,5,The best Bluetooth speaker on the market you won’t be sorry if you buy it. Plus the price on Amazon beats anywhere else.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy,5,"Loud, clear sound, very probable with great battery life"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent product! But doesn’t link to other JBL speakers,4,"The only thing I don’t like about this speaker is that it doesn’t link to other JBL speakers. That is part of the reason I bought it, so I was disappointed in that. It sounds amazing and I take it everywhere!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a good product,5,I really like this wireless speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Item,5,Awesome audio with great battery
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The battery only lasts 3 to 4 hours at max volume,2,"I bought this speaker just over 3 months ago.  I used it every day for the first 3 weeks or so then not at all until the last couple days.  When I was first using it the battery would last at least 12 hours if not more.  After its last use I fully charged it, unplugged it, and set the speaker aside.  After a month and a half or so I picked it up and turned it on.  After 3 1/2 hours it was dead, i figured it lost some of its charge because it had been sitting unused for a while.  I let it charge over night and the next day same thing, 3 1/2 hours and the battery is dead. I like the speaker, it sounds great, but I'm disappointed with the battery life.EDIT: I found an article explaining the battery life issue.  The speaker was tested at MAX volume and lasted 4 hours but when tested between 50% - 75% it hit the 12 hour mark.  I personally think that if you advertise a 12 hour battery life it better be 12 hours at max performance!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Works perfectly for the deck and pool.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","The seller was great, product arrived precisely on time and in a ...",5,"I have just got my two Brand New JBL FLIP 4 speakers but I simply can't pair it with my Galax S8 Plus device.  Only with I Phones.The seller was great, product arrived precisely on time and in a beutifull sealed original box.The issu described here is about the product itself. That is the reason for my low rate."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality for the price,4,Great product. Got several compliments about its volume at work. It loses charge rather quickly in my opinion. Overall it’s good quality for the price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty good speaker,4,"Decent sound, excellent battery life, easy to sync with.  I have not tested the water resistance of it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Performs as Rick,5,Performs well with music and time keeping software for RSO shooting events
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No wire to electric outlet?,5,"it is good and works great.  But I realize that it needs a connection to an electric outlet, even if only to recharge the battery, and so far as I checked it arrived without the wire to connect to the outlet."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker,5,Hud and loves this speaker and Case
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Has great sounds,5,I love it! It is very loud as well
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"I've had this speaker for a week or so now, and I must say this thing is build solid. It has some heft to it which I love. I know that if it drops it won't just shatter. This things gets pretty loud. The bass is great for how small it is. I may look into some JBL headphones next."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money,5,My son loves it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Price,5,Sound good for size connected fast and easy
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,"Purchased this for our family trip to Florida. The sound quality is amazing, it is smaller than I anticipated (which is a good thing) light weight making it so easy to carry on the airplane. I will be purchasing again for each family member since we all enjoy different styles of music."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not bad... Battery life isn’t as promised.,3,"I got the teal one for my birthday. I love the color, the sound, my phone connects to it with no problem. But I dropped 2 stars b/c the 12hrs of continuous play is a joke. Mine won’t even get 5hrs continuous play. So far it hasn’t been a problem bc I’m @ home enjoying it but if I ever take it somewhere not even getting half what’s promised might suck. Better take a battery pk with you or charging cable. Not going to last 12hrs. Still a good speaker but if it dying after less than half that times a problem you might look elsewhere."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life,5,"The battery life and sound quality are amazing, didnt last as long as i would hope on full volume. Although if you drop it down a couple notches it last twice as long if not longer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Durable and Good Quality,5,I bought this speaker for my father who spends a lot of time outside doing manual labor. It’s very durable and has a great sound. He loves it! Battery life is surprisingly long lasting as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It is worth the money,5,This is a really good speaker so worth it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny!,5,Best probable speaker we've ever had!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Love taking it out on our boat and by the pool
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,So far this has been a great little speaker that sounds great. We using golfing and hanging out in the backyard. Very happy with the purchase
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the price,5,"Great sound for the price.  More volume and low end than similar, more expensive competitors.  Battery lasts a long time. Bluetooth is a little finicky on my Flip 4, but I purchased one for my daughter, and she never has trouble connecting.  May just be this unit."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound quality, price and color choices !",5,Bought JBL Flip 4 for my 18 year old son for Christmas.  Nice gray color.  The sound is fantastic for the price.  I bought one in black last year and I love it.  Very reasonable price for a great product!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,4,"The speaker sounds great, but the first one we purchased stopped working after about a week.  We contacted JBL to troubleshoot and, after unsuccessfully walking us through a number of possible fixes, they had us return it to them and they replaced it - took about 10 days.  So far, so good with the replacement."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound for a little speaker,5,"This speaker is great with my laptop.  I use it for music, to listen to podcasts, and to give presentations that include video clips.  It will crank up the volume!  I ordinarily buy Bose.  But I did research in Consumer Reports, and online, and this little unit got high praise.  I see why!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",would recommend!,5,"I got the flip 4 after hours of looking for a good portable speaker around $80-100, and this was recommended by many different YouTubers. I’ve had it for 2 months so far and It works great, I use it on a daily basis and it’s never let me down."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nicely Done,5,"Sounds great, and the carrying case is nicely done also"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is the best price you will find,5,It was the best price for this amazing Bluetooth speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great sound with long battery life!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Easy connection, long life",5,Had this for a while now and it is still working great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,4,After I connected to my iPhone 7 the phones  speaker suddenly stopped working. Which was suspicious... But the jbl speaker’s a champ!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The color!!!!!,5,So glad I went with this purchase. I wouldn’t let the negative reviews steer you away. The battery life in this speaker really is amazing. The sound is super loud and it’s very easy to set up once and ready to go on Bluetooth. Also the dark teal color is beautiful!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,Great sound quality. Good battery life. Really enjoying it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really crisp sound and great bass. I would recommend,4,This little speaker kicks!  Really crisp sound and great bass.  I would recommend.  Cool feature is you can link with other jbl...so you could have 20 or these all around the house!  One alone will fill a room im thinking cool for surround even.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","then it's a great product, but if you're buying 2 in order ...",3,"If you're buying a single one of these, then it's a great product, but if you're buying 2 in order to use them in stereo, they are pretty bad. The problem is with the connect+ app, so as long as they don't update it this doesn't do what flip 3 and the old connect app can do. old connect firmware remembers your setting as to play in stereo mode or party mode even after shutting down the units, but on the new one if you connect one of them via aux cable, they revert back to party mode as soon as you turn off your phone's screen."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great must-buy!,5,A friend has a similar speaker that we took to the beach.  I was sold!  So I found this model (more updated than hers) for a party I was hosting in my home.  1)  easy Bluetooth use; 2) I can put this speaker most anywhere in my house or yard and play selections from my phone and iPad anywhere in my home.  LOVE it!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good bass!,5,"Besides the bad reviews, I love this speaker. It has great bass as well as volume. I am very happy with this purchase. Will most definitely purchase again in the future!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worthy purchase,5,Great value for the price and good sound quality for the size. This speaker has been dropped by my kids and still works perfectly. I dont worry about spills or it being by the pool. Worthy purchase and I would buy again.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound,5,Sound great and battery life last for long time
"JBL Flip 4, Black","GREAT sound, great bluetooth connection, bad connection to other JBL speakers",3,"I have a hard time connecting to other JBL speakers, it connects to phone quickly, but it's supposed to connect to 100 speakers and i don't see how when it keeps cutting up the music, chopped up sound. I LOVE the idea, but haven't been able to make it work. I will update if it changes for me. I've had them since November. JBL charge 3, and two of the JBL Flip 4."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great  / Rugged Speaker for the summer outdoors (or anywhere),5,"I love these speakers.  My nephew dropped one of these in the kids wading pool... no big deal, and they link up which is awesome.  They put out enough sound for a good size party, and have bass response that's pretty good.  The link up feature is great but sometimes it takes a few seconds to start working, or get your JBL app to work right."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small and light weight makes it easy to carry,5,"Goes a 10+ hour shift with no problem. Only uses one or two of the 5 battery life dots. Small and light weight makes it easy to carry, hang and find a good location to set it down. Only downfall I have found so far is another copy worker appears to have liked it. They must have borrowed it as I haven't seen it in nearly two weeks..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I'm not hulk,4,"The only thing I really hate about the product at the moment is how I need to press on it a bit hard to power on and pair. Like cmon, you think I'm hulk or something?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker.,5,I’m in love. This is a great speaker. Has great sound and volume too. I use it a lot. I love the size too as I like to travel a lot. And I listen to music daily. I love that two devices can be hooked up to it at the same time too. Great quality too.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Needed a blue tooth speaker for out by our pool. This mighty little speaker is it. Sounds great unless you just need to spend money. Very pleased with purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fake JBL from Abe’s Electronic Center,1,"Unfortunately the speaker I ordered 6 months ago is not authentic, coming from Abe’s Electronic Center. I was very skeptical at the beginning and I wanted to hold up the warranty that was expected from this company, though trying to contact them multiple occasions was useless as I was sent to contact JBL for warranty, so neither of them would guarantee a warranty as expected. JBL speakers ARE AMAZING, unless they’re fraudulent. Abe’s Electronic center I just contacted a few minutes ago was a representative who was extremely rude and kept on reading amazons customer service number and calling me wrong. Beforehand, I contacted amazon before that and they instructed me to call Abe’s Electronic Center. Overall the speaker I purchased was fake and I’m extremely disappointed I lost my money when i made this purchase. The speaker I have does not retain the same bass quality, the durability isn’t real as the RUBBER edges are now peeling off which can be seen on the front and at the bottom of the left speaker. The stitching between the fake (left) and real (right) JBL speakers are also different where in person I can see through the stitching for the fraudulent speaker. The fake one is smaller and the quality is noticeably lacking. No longer can I trust online purchases from Amazon for simple speaker brands as the authenticity is questionable, ultimately I am NOT satisfied."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Totally satisfied,5,Not only is the product great.  The seller sent it across country in 3 days. Super happy. Super satisfied.  Thank you so much. Stay safe and healthy.Michael Cooney

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Has Almoststopped working completely,3,"I have no idea what happened but I bought these last May and they're about to completely stop working. The sound is not coming out clearly anymore; everytime there's even a small base in the song, the speakers sound like it's banging against a wall. Everytime I skip a song or even choose a song, it skips/scratches part of the song. I can't even remember the last time I've dropped it or the last time it's been around water; and even so they said it was waterproof. Only positive thing about this is that the battery life they advertise is pretty accurate."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Unbelievable sound in a small package,5,Amazing how this technology keeps getting better and better.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just as good as a Bose,5,Superb sound and definitely holds its own against my husband's Bose.  Super easy hookup and decent battery life.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker!,5,This the second JBL Flip 4 speaker that I have purchase. We purchased the second on to sync them together for a surround sound while we are outside. We took the first one on a camping trip and attached the speaker to our river tubes. The speaker got wet and did submerge but continued to blast out our tunes! It was a great purchase.

(Maybe like 10 hrs?)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The speaker is great and puts out amazing sound,4,"The speaker is great and puts out amazing sound. It also comes in useful anywhere.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL is the best,5,I bought this speaker to use in our pool area. The sound is amazing and the speaker is easy to pair with your iPhone once you download the JBL connect app. I’d really like to buy another one to pair it with in the future. This speaker is great value for the money. JBL has never let me down.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Outstanding product,5,"It is everything that JBL describes of their product.  It connects seamlessly via Bluetooth connectivity. The battery life lasts a very long time if the volume is low to midrange, shorter if the volume is louder.  Can't ask for better."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It holds a charge nicely. Using it at the pool and on my ...,5,"THIS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!! It's so much louder than I thought it would be, comparing my previous 3 bt speakers. It holds a charge nicely. Using it at the pool and on my back porch with friends.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Me gusta,5,"Tiene buen sonido, se conecta con cualquiera de mis dispositivos, obviamente aunque sea resistente al agua y a la mayoría de los golpes, es mejor tratar de evitar esponerlo a eso, si se quiere que tenga una vida util razonable."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AWESOME!!!,5,"This bluetooth speaker is amazing!  The sound quality is excellent, even at peak volume.  My husband and I use this speaker practically every day.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Impressed,5,I debated heavily between the Flip 4 and the Charge 3. Flip 4 still has enough bass for everyday use and I decided I can add the more bassier Charge 3 at any time and pair them for events or just when I'm in the mood. How simple a decision once I thought of it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great speaker for golf cart.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker,4,It’s a very nice speaker for its price. Has a really good battery life as long you aren’t playing on max volume. Only problem I’ve seen is some songs that have too much bass start to sound kinda bad.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I am so happy my son suggested I buy this speaker,5,I am so happy my son suggested I buy this speaker!!  Listening to music via phone or computer speakers is horrendous.  This is the added Punch I've needed for a long time.!!!!  Great sound? absolutely!  Portable??  Awesomely so!! Set up?  Couldn't be easier!  Price?  I'd pay double!!  JBL?  Need I say more??????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not trustworthy.,2,I have had this product since January.  This is the 2nd speaker that has been sent.  I struggle bad with it just cutting off.  Unless completely connected to the charger as well as cutting off on the charger.  I am a yoga teacher and have been weary of using it in class.  But now starting to travel and teach more I would like to be able to take it with me wherever I go.  I do not trust the speaker at all.  People keep telling me that all Bluetooth speakers do that.  Tho Iv come across many teachers who are satisfied with the speaker they use.  This speaker has been unpredictable since day one.  Even after receiving the second one.  It really bums me out and I do not trust this to take with me and teach.  I would hate to dive people into a deep yoga/ music journey and the it just cuts off on me.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Does not float. Ha ha!!!,5,Great product! I thought that it would project sound if it was floating in the water (pix made it look so) but It makes sense that it doesn’t.  But really still enjoy this little guy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Full range of sound,5,Sounds great. Full range of sound. Can easily up the bass depending on what you place next to it. Super fun for shower. Love that the volume control buttons are so easy to find and feel.  Husband got it for me for Christmas but it would make a great gift for a Teen.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Love this thing, the sound is amazing.",5,"I was on my brother in laws boat and he was playing music from this JBL Flip 4 and I thought this had the best sound I've heard in such a small unit. It has strong but clear lows with smooth highs that are not too tinny. I would put this up against Bose any day and it's much less than the Bose. I love it, and it's waterproof...."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Muy buen sonido,5,No me dura mucho la batería pero lo demás excelente
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome little speaker!,5,"Bought this for my husbands birthday....He loves it, says it is the single best present I’ve ever given him, even over the iPad!  He loves the portability of it, and takes it to different areas of the house to listen to his music from his phone.  It’s got great sound, and we use it in our home gym while working out...It was a great purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love my jbl great product,5,The media could not be loaded.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"Zero complaints, great speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday.  We can not be more pleased.  No, it is not a 10"" woofer and a tower full of tweeters.  But for its size, it really has a great sound.  Battery life seems pretty good to me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Camping yaking partying it works everywhere
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,I would bury it again!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Bluetooth Speaker,5,"Great size, excellent sound quality and easy to connect Bluetooth."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Need to keep your phone next to the speaker,3,"I was so happy to have this, worked like a dream at my house in my backyard. However I started work at an essential child care camp and I’m the same distance as I am to my speaker and I have been having bad connection issues and glitching. Very disappointed. Even updated and reset my speaker, the issue persists!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Washer Friendly!,5,"Wow - came home from a trip, dumped my dirty laundry and Flip 4 into the washer; full cycle, then wondered why the dryer was making a loud banging sound.  The Flip 4, protected in the clothes, was unscathed!  Works just like it did before.  I was astounded - very glad I got the latest model now - had no idea it would withstand such a water torture."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,5,Has an awesome sound. Love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice little speaker with nice sound for its size,5,"Nice little speaker with nice sound for its size.The only downside to it (and I knew this before buying it) the FLIP 4 does NOT FLOAT! So be careful out on the lakes, rivers, etc.If floating is important to you, you might consider a small step up to the JBL Charge 3 as it does float."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing speaker,5,"Like the sound quality, also battery life is so convenient. I don't always have to charge everyday. Worth the money"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great buy!!!,5,Great item! Works more then perfect! Sound is clear and strong!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome,4,This BT speaker is as advertised . For less than $100 its a good value.My recommendation would be to download the eq app that comes up in the play store when you do a search for JBL flip 4. It works. I bought the no ad version for $2.50. Cheap. Love it.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Can take anywhere,5,Sounds great even better when there’s more than one
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small size Huge sound!!,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this speaker at first. When I got it I knew right away I’d be happy with it. Heavy, good construction and solid controls. Easy Bluetooth pairing and massive sound for a speaker this size. Totally blown away that a speaker this size can deliver this loud and crisp sound. Great buy and built to last."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing little speaker,5,Love the quality sound!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",That the keep battery so long.,5,I love it. I hear music everyday.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This is a great product! I love the size and sound,5,This is a great product! I love the size and sound. I use it for my classroom and outside as well. I purchased the case and it was a good buy. It is very durable and looks great. The one thing I would improve is the max volume. It is loud enough inside but could be a little louder outside. Overall I love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality and very convenient,5,"We are so pleased with these speakers! My husband is an audiophile and loves the sound quality, and I love that we are now wire-free and can connect the music to multiple speakers at the same time. We use them everywhere, in different rooms around the house, in the shower, on trips. So versatile!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big Sound in a Small Package,5,This thing pumps out sound better than other products that cost double. Very impressive little device. It’s also very waterproof. Was dunked underwater for 2 min and still worked perfectly . I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an easy affordable way to bring high quality sound with you wherever you go.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent speaker,5,I loved the small compact size.  The sound has the feeling of a much larger size speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s long battery life,5,Sound Quality is excellent!

 Love it bass is great"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Music sounds great,5,This is the second one I have purchased
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The best portable speaker I've owned,5,Definitely worth it. I use this speaker everyday. I can go about three to 4 days of using it for about 4 to 5 hours at work with out charging it. The sound quality is very impressive for a speaker it's size and I've never had a problem with its connectivity.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great ??!!!!!,5,Flip 4 is a Great Product. I purchased this for travel to use on vacation. By far great sound and very lightweight. I put in my backpack so it will make it to my destination. Easy to charge and play time is all day on one charge.You won’t be disappointed.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good speaker. I use it in a very noisy ...,5,"Very good speaker. I use it in a very noisy welding shop and can hear it most of the time fairly well. Wish it was just a bit louder but it has pretty small speakers in it so that's asking a lot. If you buy this and don't use it in an extremely noisy environment, it will be plenty loud for you."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great speaker. Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it much better than the $25 speaker it is replacing. It sounds great with podcasts/audiobooks as well as music. No complaints.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",easy and convenient with great sound,5,LOVE this speaker!!!! Works great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,4,Very great speaker is worth the money for sure. I use my speaker more than most people I’m sure of. But my battery has shorter life span than expected.. could be worse though. Thank yu JBL I’ve been a loyal customer for years.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super good,5,Very good I love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,Every thing about this speaker we like.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery lasts 3.5 hours at full volume.,2,"I like the camouflage design, like the volume, dislike the battery life. My workplace is a warehouse where I load delivery trucks (funny, right?). When the belt is on, my work environment is VERY loud and I needed a speaker that could drown out THAT noise with my own music. I've used it twice at work so far and with the volume all the way up the battery life lasts 3.5 hours. I need the speaker to work twice as long. If the product states on the box that it's going to last 12 hours, then it should last 12 hours even when the volume is up all the way. Still a good speaker but the battery life is a deal breaker for me. I'll give it try again with the volume not all the way up and then update if needed.**Update. Used it today at work with the volume not all the way up and it lasted the same. The box says it is supposed to last 12 hours yet it didn't even do half of that. I am returning."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Incredible Sound,5,"I bought this to use on deck and patio for evening dinners. It is durable and produces the best sound! No more need for speakers and wires. This connects perfectly with the cell phone and streams music, phone calls, or anything that you could hear from your cell phone. Worth the purchase!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Decent speaker, cute color",4,Cute and easy to use. I wish the volume louder
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker I’ve ever purchased!,5,This speaker is awesome!!! I was going between the 3 & the 4 and I’m glad I went with the 4 because it’s perfect. The sound quality is great and has just enough bass for the loudness!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,My husband was absolutely IN LOVE WIT HIS SPEAKER! Well I messed it up on accident and it got run over by a car. :(
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery seems to last for awhile,5,Like the Bluetooth good distance
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Grate by well worth the money,5,The sound quality is amazing and setup was easy the only thing i didnt like is i didnt by two
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,This little JBL has the best sound of any bluetooth speaker I've purchased to date. Use it while camping a was surprised at how good it sounded.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,"We are in love with this speaker. We were instructed not to touch the smaller ends. I’m not sure I would have figured that out myself. The bass emits from the ends and those parts are a bit fragile. Otherwise, I’m in love. It’s loud. Rich. And portable. What else do you want for $100?"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the money!,5,Sounds great for the size. Good value for what you get.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the price,4,This product is good to use for small parties and in-home. But the sound is amazing. The speakers are really awesome. Worth a try.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,4,"I bought my speaker around nov, it’s super awesome! It’s already January and all of a sudden the speaker distorts the sounds of the music so I had to call and replace it. I hope I don’t have a problem with the replacement, other than that I can’t complain"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Buy!!!,5,I got tired of buying those cheap speakers that would go dead every hour. I really like this speaker. It has great sound quality and the speaker itself is very durable and it connects to my IPhone XS Max very fast.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Soft or Loud,5,Great little speaker.  Connects to my Android TV as well as my iPhone.  Use it by the pool and don't have to worry about it getting wet. The pictures show it standing upright.  The music is much better sounding when the speaker is positioned sideways.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound,5,Love my speaker sounds awesome!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Definetly Recommended.,5,I bought more than one and the conectivity between them as with the bluetooth is prety good. The sound quality is very decent and the battery life is as advertise. The two I have serve me good for ambient music hosting birthdays and parties in my patio.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,I just love my speaker it makes me so happy
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Puts out great sound, I typically have to tel him to ...",5,"Ordered by my husband. We take this speaker almost everywhere when traveling. Puts out great sound, I typically have to tel him to turn it down. Used at the beach on a day with rain showers, the speaker never got “soaked” but certainly wet due to wind and had no issues. Great carrying/storage case."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",ONLY PLAYED 4 HOURS,2,"After a full overnight charge, it played less than 4 hours at half volume before it died. ON THE FIRST DAY?! Says it plays 12 hours. Definitely not worth the price. I have a 25$ speaker that plays seven hours on one charge. Much less running time than I expected. If it needs to be recharged after just a few hours ,it’s Not enough value for my hard earned money. Its getting returned straight away. Yes, it sounds pretty good, and has decent volume, but if it only lasts a few hours on a charge it isn’t worth 80$, not to me. Maybe I got a “Bad” one? But then... if you do t have quality control, that’s on you, not me. Wasted time,and effort...."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for teens.,5,My grandchildren already had this speaker. Wanted another so they wouldn't have to share. They love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Short battery life. No good for beach trips!,3,"I really love the speaker, my complaint is the battery life! It only lasts about 3 hours on a full charge, listening to it with the volume all the way up. That’s very disappointing. I really want to give it 5 stars but based on that, I can’t. Other reviews and even the specs say it should last much longer but I’ve tried it on 3 different occasions, each time it died.. pretty disappointing since the main reason I bought it was to take to the beach and river for the day. Maybe I got a defective one?? Idk.."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surround sound,5,Best purchase ever.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Buy!,5,"I bought the Flip 4 and it was a great purchase. 1. It is really loud, especially if you pair it up with others. 2. It is a good design and not bulky. The bass is there just not too deep but what can you expect from a portable speaker. 3. It's loud really loud.I liked it so much I bough another one for my wife."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing,5,"Pros : JUST GET IT... It’s well built, sounds amazing super loud and has an excellent battery lifeCons: none really...

The unit will stop charging because of the connection port, at about a year. SO I bought the extended warranty this time for $2.95 and that is the way to go. For the price, this is the best product I can find and it does rock. ONLY if you could put these speakers in series."

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound and connectivity but everything else, blah.",3,"It looks great and it sounds very good for the size of the speaker. The reason I give it 3 *s is because of the recharge options.  It only comes with a USB charger for your computer. So besides the almost $100 you spend on the speaker, you have to spend extra money if you want to charge it up through an outlet. To me, it seems like that kind of thing should be included. To me, it makes me feel taken advantage of and nickel and dimed for extra money."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for me!,5,I’ve gone through a few Bluetooth speakers and this one is perfect! I have not tested it at the beach yet; however from my kitchen I hear it loudly throughout my 2 story townhome so I’m sure it will be great

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Does not work very well when plugged in.,3,"REVIEW AFTER 6+ MONTHS*** As a portable bluetooth speaker it works great connected to my smartphone. Excellent for camping, although I haven't tried throwing it in the pool to test how waterproof it really is. Although it does not connect to my 2014 Toshiba laptop well in the case of bluetooth it is muffled and scratchy like an old radio and when connected via a regular mini cable it cuts off sound at low volumes, making the speaker useless for watching movies. I still like it for walking around the house, but useless for connecting to the laptop."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Superb.,5,Love it. Excellent all ways.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound you need outside,5,The sound you need outside
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Does the job, but there are better options for cheaper",3,"Likes:It's well-built and durable. I've used it it hanging from the showerhead and it seems pretty waterproof, but I haven't submerged it. Battery life is solid.Dislikes:It sounds fine until you hit about half volume - after that it gets muddier the louder it goes. Seems like JBL was happy to sacrifice sound quality to advertise higher dB levels. I purchased this to replace a much cheaper Oontz speaker that went bad after three years of abuse - wish that I had stuck with that brand instead of paying more for this."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,"Absolutely love it,  I use it for everything from talking through it for a phone call,  listening to music and watching movies..... It's like c4 small but packs alot if power..... You'll be surprised on how good it sounds....."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic!,5,Love my Flip 4!  Love the color and sound is great.  Full of sound at a low setting.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Boom!,5,Sounds like those old surround sound systems blasting
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,"I have the JBL Flip 3 and just love it so it only made sense when I wanted a bigger speaker for shop use to upgrade to the Flip 4 and I couldn't be happier.  Rich, clear sound with good base and absolutely outstanding build quality. I recommend this speaker to anyone just as I did with the Flip 3. You wont go wrong by purchasing these JBL products"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,This product came promptly and it functions well. I have no complaints and I have had it for over two months. I also paired it with another speaker and it did well then too. It’s nice and easy to take on the go. So glad I purchased it.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wasteful! Short lived,2,"We received a flip as a gift and loved the sound quality, so purchased 2 more as gifts for others.

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Very good, but tragedy struck!",5,I freaking loved this speaker! I took it tubing down a river and it was awesome until I bumped into a tree and it fell off my ice chest and drowned. I’m heart broken cuz I just bought it too and now it’s swimming with the fishes. ??

"JBL Flip 4, Black",It is great!,5,I love it. I take it fishing and to the basketball court. Everyone always asks me about it b/c they like it. It sounds great. I always listen to it at max volume so the battery last 4-5 hours. I wish that was longer. I recommend you buy it and you wont regret it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery Life Grossly Misrepresented,3,"I bought this speaker to put in my UTV. The sound quality is awesome, but the battery life stinks. I was going to buy a second one for our other UTV, but I think I'll pass. If you're looking for something with a long battery life, this isn't for you."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente producto,5,"Buen diseño, sonido agradable y potente."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing Bluetooth speaker!,5,"I LOVE this Bluetooth speaker! I haven't tried it out at its full volume (don't want to bother the neighbors) or capabilities, but the volume and bass are amazing. My main priorities when looking for a speaker are volume and bass, anyways, and this hits both of those marks."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A great Bluetooth speaker,5,"I love my speaker. I use it in the kitchen while I'm cooking. I listen to YouTube, Pandora and movies from my tablet. It syncs easily to most devices. The sound is perfect for a small room. The power lasts longer than I expected. I will buy another one to use together."

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Not super loud, good bass",4,"I love this speaker a lot, the only downside to it is, that it’s not as loud as I would like, but that is to be expected from a speaker of this size."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not as loud as I expected,3,It's a nice little speaker but it doesn't fill up the room and for JBL I expected a little bit more but it's still a good personal speaker to have
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bricked after four months. Won’t accept charge,1,"I got this unit in the army green as an upgrade to a failed JBL flip 3 and I couldn’t have been more excited about it’s upgraded features,  huge and easy to access buttons, sexy look, and vibrant sound. Sadly, the enthusiasm lasted but a short four months. After said four months, the speaker started exhibiting a strange behavior. First when I would power I noticed that one of the four LED power level lights was out.  Shortly after that, a second LED failed and the next day all of them went the way of the do-do bird.No biggy. I can live without LEDs.  But, a few days after that, I noticed it would not except a charge unless I shook it. Within a week, even the shaking no longer worked and the unit is now a dang paperweight.Sadly, I am done with JB. I say “sadly” because I have been a multi-multi-year customer of the JBL flip line — buying the original, 2 flip 2s, 2 flip 3s, and a 4 (lots of brothers and sisters who like them as gifts). But they just keep failing for me/us.I don’t get them very wet. I don’t ever drop them. I take care of my electronics more carefully then I take care of my wife."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,"My son loves it. He can take it anywhere with him, on his bike, out in the yard playing or in the barn. Battery last a couple days, and fits very well in the case we got"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,Great little speaker and sound quality is great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent product!,4,"Sound quality amazing. Portable, small, stylish, discreet. My only complaint is that battery life is not great. I wish it were at least 12 to 14 hours, instead of 8."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound Quality,5,I bought this for my mom for Mothers Day and both my parents love it. It has great sound quality for its size and they love using it at the beach and pool.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect for the price,5,Not the loudest speaker out there however for the price is amazing. I use it inside my food truck and I keep all employees and customers dancing
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disappointing sound at this price point.,3,"I must say that sound is rather disappointing. This speaker is way overpriced for the sound quality it delivers. If you’re looking for a small, portable speaker to take for a trip, or to the beach, it’s okay, though even than it could be smaller. If you not that concerned with portability and looking for a great sound for a deck or backyard or even inside, this is NOT the speaker to buy. Try Harman Kardon Onyx Studio instead that you can get for about $100."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",We party with it every weekend in the summer,5,"This thing is cheap, and as much as we use it I would have thought we would wear it out.  But it keeps going."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product all around!!,5,"I love these speakers. I purchased one for my son another for my daughter and one for myself. The battery life, though decent, could last a little longer. It would be great if it would make it through my entire work day. by today's standards though it is Top Shelf."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome product,5,Sounds great very loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",let it play,5,This thing is great. fits in my pocket. bumps pretty good sound. long battery life. happy with my purchase. great to have it around playing feel good music

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker!,4,"Great sound and pretty good bass for such a small speaker. Waterproof, long battery life, great sound.  Will use for camping and outdoor movies. This thing is pretty loud so won’t be turning it to 11 at the campsite. Definitely worth the $85. Would purchase again for sure."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A weird speaker,3,"The sound quality is great however, EVEN when you have it charger it will die on you so BEWARE! I purchased this after losing my beats pills (btw a great speaker..plays music while Charger). This speaker gets a 3 star. CHARGE IT TO THE FULLEST if you wanna use it half a day!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound.,5,Durable and easy to connect.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",????,5,Muy buena inversion????.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,5,Great sounding but I like little more power.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic!!,5,Excellent speaker! Great sound and sturdy! I've accidentally dropped the speaker a few times from high places and it's still just like new! Highly recommended!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,It is exactly what I wanted.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality sound,4,"Very balanced decent quality sound.  You'll get the best sound if you can eq your music,  I found it a breaking up in the lower registers,  you'll want to eq those down."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good,5,Good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loved,5,Relaxing on the beach ??????

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful little speaker!,5,Sound quality is great!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing!!!!,5,Love this speaker!!!!! Bass is amazing! Great sound!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker ??,5,Love taking it on our boat??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product,5,Delivered as promised
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small yet powerful. Louder than the charge 3,5,"Compared to the Charge 3 much better sound. It’s what it’s made for. Instead of putting the tech in a charging port they put it in the sound. Half the size, twice the sound."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker on the market!,5,"Love this thing!  Super long battery life, easy connection and the sound quality is the best of anything I tested. If I lost this today I would immediately go buy a new one. My daughter uses it, my wife uses it and I use it all over the house."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,Got this to replace a UE Boom we had and left on vacation. The sound on this is far superior to our old one and I’ll be buying a second as they can all be linked together producing more sound. This is a great speaker. Light and powerful and deceptive for its tiny size. Buy it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever,5,The best speaker I've ever owned! My only gripe is that the battery only lasts for a few hours like most speakers do but other then that I absolutely love it! I hope the next generation of this speaker has a batter that lasts for at least 5 or 6 hours.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable sound and functionality!,5,Bought this over seven months ago and I absolutely love it.  The sound is solid and the battery life is generally about 7-8 hours.  I've used it both dry and in the pool without any interruptions.  It links up quickly with multiple devices depending on what you use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker.,5,Sounds great and the battery lasts for days!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","My dudes, very nice!!",5,Very good my dudes. Sounds pretty loud. Just make sure it’s either hanging or on the button side to make it loud.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its compact,4,"I like the compactness of the speaker, it super durable and quite loud for the size of the speaker. The battery life is fantastic"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Small and powerful,5,"This baby is amazing!!! I was surprised by its size, and I thought it cannot be powerful enough. But this baby sounds great, clearly and loudly :) battery life is very long as well"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable speaker,5,"I must say I am impressed, the sound is well balanced without the lows overpowering the highs. The battery is great and plays all day and I charge the speaker untill I go back home and I am happy with my purchase and definitely I will buy again. Kudos to JBL and Harman & Cardon for great product and to finalize my humble review. ""Amazon Rocks"""
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!,5,"I love this speaker! Great sound, bass and volume. Coupled with a great battery and a good price and we have a winner! I highly recommend this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound not waterproof,3,This is a great little speaker except it’s round and it rolls it rolled right off my dock into the water and never worked again maybe about 2 feet of water
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker everrrt,5,Amazing!!! So worth it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Sound and Product Quality,5,"I love how this speaker works! It sounds great, can take a few falls, is truly waterproof, and is stylish. The end-bass caps make it way cooler and worth the money. My only complaint is that the notification noises are loud and there is no way to turn them down/turn them off."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Absolutely love it!,5,Very versatile! Awesome sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really nice,5,"Wanted a speaker for my kids to use in the bathroom. They both like taking a shower with music and I don't like them taking their devices in the bathroom... so... got this speaker. It paired easily, sounds great and holds a charge well. What's not to like? It's everything you want from a speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I have a moderate to severe hearing loss with my ...,4,"I have a moderate to severe hearing loss with my hearing aids on the sounds from the JBL were rich and clear for me, at a pleasant loudness for the Hearing folks. Without my hearing aids on will be a different story."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL SPEAKER,5,Fits all my needs—sound quality is excellent
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase,5,Bought for my husband as a Father’s Day gift. He recently traveled with it and I’m convinced he absolutely loves it. The sound is amazing. Great purchase and i bought the carrier to allow him to store it properly and make easy for packing for travel.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",??,5,This product is great perfect to play when around the house
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Soumd,5,Like the product. Nice color
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker review,5,Sounds great for such a little speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it,5,It's amazing sounds good and super loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL jubilee,5,"Except for the price which isn’t terrible but it isn’t cheap, the JBL Flip 4 is great! The sound is outstanding, and being able to pair it with another speaker is nice."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Definately worth the price,5,"Sound quality amazing, battery life long lasting"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Hate it. Acceptable sound, but awful features.",1,"I bought the Flip 4 because I love my 1st generation Flip.  Sound on the Flip 4 is ok, but a bit muddy; acceptable for a small speaker. The other features of this device have led me to hate it.  The bright blue back lit buttons are extremely bright and make using the device at night a pain. When powering up it plays a loud jingle followed by another when bluetooth connects. Volume for the startup and connect jingles is _loud_ regardless of the volume setting for music. When you power off, yet another jingle plays, also loud even if the device volume was set low while playing.  I (and others that I found on G) have searched for a way to disable the jingle or fix the volume without relief. Also, when adjusting the device volume it actually lowers the volume on my phone. When I use my phone after the Flip I have to increase the volume first. Unlike the first generation device, this one won't power off on its own, so the bright blue light will stay lit all night long. There is smart phone software available to control the Flip. Other than the ability to connect multiple Flips to the same audio stream (haven't tried) the software is pretty pointless. It also requires that your phone's GPS is available to it, so it was uninstalled."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great!,4,"Love the product sound great and I’m really enjoying it, only problem was I did not get the color tht I ordered but amazons great support team understood the situation and get the problem resolved right away wich I’m very grateful!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",not 10% waterproof,3,"this item is not 100% waterproof, my daughter thought it would work in the shower, it did for a couple of times then died!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker for the money.,5,Great little portable speaker for the money.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!,5,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I was initially impressed by the packaging. Very easy to set up and I am anything but tech savvy. I was completely blown away by the sound this put out! It is crisp and clear! Even outside in our yard it was incredible. I am purchasing another to pair for a surround sound outside! Don't hesitate!!! For the price, the JBL Flip 4 is outstanding!!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This speaker was better than i thought it would be,5,"This speaker was better than i thought it would be.  Great sound, decent bass.  Mids and treble sound really good.  IT is waterproof...it went for a swim in the ocean by accident and works flawlessly still!  I want another one to use the JBL connect plus feature.  Great for the price"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Surprisingly powerful,5,This tiny speaker surprised me --- filled a 30' x 20' room with dance music and lasted all three hours of the party. Now my son uses it to listen to music at the beach and loves it. Very quick ship - good product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pirtable,5,Good value
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good bang for the buck,5,"This speaker performs great for the price point. I’m glad I went with this instead of a larger one. It’s plenty loud for when I want to play music, but not crank it so loud as to have all the neighbors have to hear it too. Battery life is pretty good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Satisfied,5,Sound quality is good enough and it survived a few dunks in the pool over the summer. It's not going to beat your home theater system but probably sounds a lot better than other small BT speakers. I was impressed by the lows/mids on such a small speaker. Switching phones and connecting to bluetooth is effortless. Overall impressed and happy with my purchase.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",this speaker is awesome..,5,"this speaker is awesome....i've had it for 3-4 months now. between myself and friends it's been dropped several times, had my cat knock it off my couch too...still pumping out good music and has been unaffected the roughness. i'd def recommend this....my buddy has a UE Boom 2 and my sound quality is better than his, at half the cost."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounds,5,Great sounds quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Lasted 15 months and the Base booster blew out,2,"This is a great speaker if you don't mind replacing it every 15 months.  One day I turned this on and the base was completely blown out.  I thought maybe it was a glitch, so I bought a Flip 5 to replace it.  It lasted exactly 15 months again before the sound started cutting in and out.  The warranty is 1 year of course.  I'll never buy this brand again"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,5,great overall sound and bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker amazing sound,5,Absolutely best speaker I have ever bought. Has amazing base and amazing sound the battery seems to last pretty long. And so far I’ve dumped it into the water many times and have never had an issue!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker!!,5,"I choose this JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth speaker to go along with my ZTE SPRO2 micro projector for watching movies when I go camping. It was very easy to pare with the projector, I put on the Star Wars Rouge one movie and the sound was outstanding! This is exactly what I was looking for.The base and mid range for movies is perfect."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This tiny speaker is LOUD!,5,"I  have a Marshall Stanmore. I like it. Its beautiful and fills the room with sound with clarity but it aint portable. This Flip4 is awesome. Its tiny, portable and sounds great. Its actually very loud. It might even be louder than the Stanmore. How did they do that? This is the loudest portable speaker I've ever heard."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great all around speaker.,4,This is a very decent speaker.  Sound quality is very nice.  My father-in-law has a Bose (non-portable) speaker and I think this sound quality is better for a fraction of the price.  Interface and set-up is a snap.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,4,"Love this device! Sounds great, but I initially connected my phone to the speaker and now I cannot I connect for someone else to connect."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, sounds amazing!",5,"I wanted one of these speakers for years after I heard the sound quality at a friend's house, I decided to bite the bullet and get one and I couldn't be happier. Battery does last 10 to 11 hours with constant playing on a full charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase..,5,Love it...it goes with me everywhere.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",none,4,Everything
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best small portable bluetooth speaker for 2018 hands down,5,"Best small portable bluetooth speaker for 2018 hands down...sound is awesome, this is my second one so I can pair it with my Blue one...together they sound sweet...battery lasts about 6-8 hours full blast...Wherever I bring this little speaker it blows people away, especially in a small setting, the sound is rich with good base..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",No what I expected from a JBL speaker,3,Battery dies out fast and not as loud as I expected a 100 dollar speaker to sound like
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice sounds,5,Surprisingly this compact speaker packs a clear crisp sound when bluetooth. My favorite new addition while relaxing on the patio in the evenings.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality from JBL as expected,5,Great Bluetooth speaker for a really good price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The sound quality is fantastic. The music fills the room and it doesn't have to be loud.,5,I love the fact that I can take this anywhere in the house and have great music quality.  My friend told me about it and I had to have one. There are no written instructions however you're able to look them up on the computer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good at first but not for the long haul,4,"After 1 year I wouldn't recommend this speaker to anyone, it has been unrealibke and cuts out with a terrible screech when playing music, audio books and movies. Don't buy without a protection plan"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product.,5,I could get 20 hour battery life and loved the sound quality. Would buy for a family member for a present or gift.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds awesome!,5,"Excellent speaker with great sound and volume.  I got this after returning the Bose SoundLink that was such a pain to keep connected.  Easy to use, and keeps a charge for a good long time.  Just wish the charging cord wasn't orange, and that the logo wasn't red...it's an insult to my aesthetic sensibilities in my all-white room!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I have a Bose portable speaker and he always says his is better. (For the record,5,"Can't believe how much my husband loves this thing.  He's carried it around every day since I bought it.  I have a Bose portable speaker and he always says his is better.  (For the record, the JBL is more treble and the Bose is more bass, so it's a matter of opinion.)"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Full sound,5,Easy to use. Has full sound. Great product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL!,5,"This little tube is amazing. Used it for a pool party this summer.  Awesome sound, Loud and found internet connection that we did not know was there.  Great for travel.  Great in the barn, Horses were a rockin!!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,Love it. Pricy but it’s great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent but disappointed,3,"The connectivity of these speakers is awesome. The range is much farther than my JBL3. However, The JBL 3 sounds MUCH better than the JBL 4. The sound is crackly and definitely not as crisp and clear as my JBL 3. Very disappointed. I'm using them for surround sound for a house party, and was really hoping that the sound quality would be as good as the JBL 3. Also, the JBL 4 will not allow my JBL 3 to connect to it for ""party mode"". Boooooooooo......"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it,5,This thing is awesome.  I’m glad I purchased it. I use it every day and have had no issues.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Defective in less than 3 months.,1,This speaker was true quality. Sound was crisp & clear. Easy Bluetooth connection to iPhone. Unfortunately in less than 3 months the Bluetooth stopped connecting. Nothing would play. We followed the directions over again with no luck. Thankfully we fell within the 90 free tech support window. After troubleshooting with an amazon representative she connected us to a JBL associate who was friendly & arranged for a replacement. She sent an email with the necessary information to receive a replacement. I emailed all this back to her immediately. That was the last I’ve heard of her. ZERO customer service follow up to arrange a replacement. After emailing JBL twice still nothing. I contacted amazon to explain the situation. Amazon immediately arranged for a replacement. Return paperwork was provided & a new speaker was sent.JBL I do not trust. The Bluetooth had a defect & they failed to resolve it for me. Despite many positive reviews this is my experience. I can only hope the new speaker has longevity. I can not recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and easy to use,5,Listening to movies and music
"JBL Flip 4, Black",My husband and I Love it,5,"My husband and I LOVE it! We bbq a lot so we decided tobuy one and we have no regrets. It's a good buy for that price , excellent sound quality and I ordered the red one.. my favorite color!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the price,5,Wonderful. I use it in my grinning salon and kennel and it's loud enough to be heard over the dogs and equipment. I only plug it in every 2-3 days so the battery life is good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Bluetooth Speaker,5,"I am a huge fan of JBL bluetooth speakers and this one doesn't disappoint. Great sound! I am not a huge fan of lots of bass and this little speaker delivers just the right amount. The higher ends are crisp, clear especially acoustic guitar...my personal favorite. Overall a super little speaker that I would recommend to anyone looking for a small portable bluetooth speaker with a long range. Love it!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice and cool,5,This is good very like it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best gift idea of the year!,5,Great product. Keeps the earbuds out of my son's ears more often.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker for the price,5,"I bought one of these when they first came out.  It is a great portable speaker so we bought our daughter one for her birthday.  Instead of putting a sound system in our side by side, we use this speaker.  It has plent of volume while our trail riding."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is very good,5,The look of it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker!,5,"We have gone through our fair share of blue tooth speakers, and this is by far the best one! It’s sound quality is great, it’s Bluetooth connects to our phones within seconds, and we only have to charge it every couple of weeks (depending on usage)."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Beautiful quality sound.,5,The sound of this speaker is Amazing!!  This is a great speaker for the price. I also bought a case to put the speaker in but I'm finding I'm not really using it. The only thing I change about the speakers is I wish the battery would last longer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality small package,5,Sounds quality is much improved over jbl3 the connection the first day was amazing.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fits in my kayak perfectly!,5,"Use it at work all the time, great build and sound quality, and I get a lot of compliments. Doesn't last my full 12 hour shift with the volume over 50% though. It fits in my kayak perfectly!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",The speaker is good but very it’s very disappointing that it does not ...,4,The speaker is good but very it’s very disappointing that it does not connect to Flip3. The information was vague regarding JBL connect and connect + and I purchased this flip 4 to connect it to my flip 3 and hence a total waste.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Terrific quality, sound is amazing, convenient",5,This is perfect to use all around the house or for pairing!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good things come in small packages,5,For the size wireless speaker this product sounds nice. Has good range and clarity for a smaller speaker. If you're looking to not break the bank ans purchase a name brand product would definitely recommend this speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great overall.,4,It really does have powerful bass for such a small speaker. Build quality feels very solid. I really like this although at full volume it can distort a little depending on the type of music. Still a great buy!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow,5,"These little speakers are phenomenal.  I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, and I have some of the older JBL compact models.  These are the best sounding compact speakers I've heard, and the bass for such a small speaker is also hard to believe.  For the price and being waterproof, I doubt you would do better than these."

The sound is definitely clearer than 20-50$ options if that's what you're looking for but I don't know if you'd be happier with other options or not because this is my first purchase of a bluetooth speaker.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Doesn't support AAC or APTX codecs.,2,"UPDATE: one of the two Flip 4's purchased developed a clicking sound at higher volumes. It's still OK for a TV soundbar use or podcasts, not for music though.The speaker and overall build quality are very good, however, it's really a shame they don't support higher quality streaming that's been out for awhile. At their price point, they really should.Additionally, the sound quality seems to get worse when pairing more than one speaker.The silly noise they make when turning them on and off was really annoying, but there was an update that allows you to turn it off now.JBL, are you able to implement APTX via a firmware update? That would instantly put these speakers at the top of the pack!! Otherwise they aren't worth more than 3 stars, and that's being generous."

Now the speaker's sound quality will not perform as it used to at higher volumes, aka buzzing and cracking on low and high notes.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pairing 2 of them is awesome. I can't imagine how much better it would ...,5,"Small, but POWERFUL!! Pairing 2 of them is awesome. I can't imagine how much better it would sound with 4 paired! The depth of sound, as well as the overall clarity of sound the speaker produces is unrivaled. Great product, especially for the price. I love my JBL Flip 4 and I'm sure you will too after trying it out!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Beautiful!,5,"It sounds great, and it connects via bluetooth without any issues (unlike the previous one I bought). I just hope it's durable; if it's not, I'll be back to update this review."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality,5,"Works great but Bluetooth cuts in and out occasionally, it could just be my phone. The range of the Bluetooth is surprising! It stayed connected when I took my phone into a walk in freezer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,Works perfect use it everyday.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You get what you pay for.,5,This speaker is so amazing
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound - wont last a year,2,"We bought one JBL a while ago which just stopped charging. We liked the sound and portability so much we purchased two JBL's afterwards. First one needs to be used connected to the charger. Does horrible noises often thus, we barely use it even though we got two of them to link around the house. The first time we were able to do that was pretty neat, didn't last long. Second JBL breaks up while music is playing, very unpleasant. Checked Bluetooth connection, WIFI, battery... still breaks up. Honestly great sound but not a product that has lasted more than a year. Contacting JBL directly and hopefully their ""guarantee"" does something for us..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound!,5,I bought this for my husband's office at work and he loves it! Said it sounds great! Will be buying more for our house!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Powerful little speaker,5,Like sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jealous mama wants a JBL FLIP TOO!,5,"I purchased two one for each child: 17,19. I have an older Bose that dies occasionally. I use their speakers on occasion and I’m jealous! This speaker ia so much better than mine and easier to carry around! I’m totally getting one for me!!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent for music around my pool.,5,I bought two of these for music around my pool. I have them spread 60ft apart with zero issues with connect+ or bluetooth from my phone playing iHeart Radio. Sound is bright and clear with good bass from a speaker this size. They are plenty loud enough to fill the entire pool area at moderate volume or I could really crank them and annoy my neighbors.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",SOUND IS AMAZING,5,"Great sound, granddaughter loved it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You've got to try this speaker.,5,"What an amazing speaker. I needed something to take to Mexico for a month but was worried that the sound would be small. Having had Bose speakers in the past, I could never get past their tinny sound. I was worried this would have the same issues but I couldn't have been more wrong. Sound is fantastic, size is terrific to carry around, plus it is waterproof!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound quality.,5,Bought this for my son & we both are truly impressed with the quality of sound & the clarity.  This was an amazing deal comparable to a much more expensive unit.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and beautiful color,5,"This was smaller than I anticipated, but it has amazing sound and projects very well! It connects to your phone easily and stays connected. It is heavier than it looks (in a high quality kind of way, not cheap at all)."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Five Stars,5,"A powerful speaker with really good sound, a long battery life. Very durable it seems. My friend came home from a mission trip and accidentally washed his speaker in the washing machine and put the clothes in the dryer he heard a thumping sound. Took it out and it worked!!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product!,5,I use it when I’m four wheeling & it has great sound. Durable & water or mud haven’t harmed it. I do wish I would’ve gotten the JBL Charge 3 though as I could stand for it to be just a little louder over the sound of my atv.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome battery life,5,Great sound quality
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice job JBL,5,This little guy packs a lot of quality sound at a very  impressive price point. Nice job JBL.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",2 units both dead at just 1 yr,1,"I bought a flip4 in May 18, I bought another in Jun 18.  They have decent sound.  The first unit bought in May died in Jun 19, now the second new unit I purchased in Jun 18 is doing the same thing a month later.  It won't hold a charge sometimes and it when it does it takes about 5 hrs to recharge this is exactly like the first one did before it totally failed.Both flip4's have never been abused or even wet. I believe it is the circuit board that is cheap and defective but the battery is marginal in these things too.On the new flip5 they have replaced the cheap usb mini with a usb c charger port which is superior.  The mini charger usb is weak and easy to bend causing problems.  So good for the new usb-c port on the flip5So for about 200 bills I got about a year of moderate to light use out of these things.  I expected more from JBL and true one could just be a dud (though it shouldn't) after a year both of mine bought at different times are doing the exact same thing. I won't be buying another."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and easy connectivity to 99 other speakers,4,"While I don’t think it sounds as good as my more expensive speakers, the ability to easily pair it with 99 other JBL speakers makes it an instant favorite."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,Smaller than appeared  but also louder than I thought.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Removal Battery,3,"this is a really good product, the thing is you can get something similar for a better price, and the main issue is that people should be able to remove amd replace the battery, which after a while stops working properly, making the product very hard to use cuz you practically have to get it charged all the time"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great portable speaker,5,"We have two already, the sound quality is very good and once the bluetooth is on it connects without any issues. Sound is great whether you are listening to music or an audio book."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Xxxxxxxxxx,5,"The Flip 4 worked just the way I thought a speaker from JBL would. The sound quality is fantastic! I was a little disappointed by the distance of Bluetooth connection, but don't know if it was the speaker or the tablet I was using."

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Clear, deep, beautiful sound!",5,"This was worth every penny. Packs a punch too for when you really want to jam. Waterproof for me is a must, so that was the icing on the cake. This allows you to get great bass from a small unit, without sacrificing clarity."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",best for a few reasons,5,"It is not a bose. You want this size, not to big and the next size down loses a lot of sound quality. Best thing is it can link with with other jbl speakers wireless, creating a great atmosphere if others have these too"

 I Love this product, sound quality amazing. Very loud highly recommend"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound but could use a little more base,4,"Good sound but could use a little more base. And speaking of ""base"" it could use a base to sit on. This thing is a tube and will roll away from you if your not careful."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent you will be happy.,5,Excellent sound.  Amazing small for its clarity.Crispness can be heard on guitar or violin recordings.Surprised that some digital recordings I have played on other speakers were muffled or distorted.A friend who is pro violinist both concert and weddings and red-neck showed me it.He was very happy and had a selection of various pieces.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not full like JBLs should be,3,"Thin sound for JBL. Treble is dominant- little mid and very little bass.  From JBL, I expect much fuller sound. It's an odd little speaker. Because if it's shake some kart is always pointing at the surface on which it is sitting. It's heavy, but solid. Connects without any trouble - Just turn both devices on - no having to switch off and on to find each other. Doesn't drop off. Cable is solid. If Harmon/JBL has a bass device that connects/pairs I may pick it up. This jack if full sound grates on me."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,Love this. Bought 2 and they connect just like they should. It is loud enough for me to use in my riding arena
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever,5,Great value!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",For size it's got some nice kick,5,For a lil guy this thing can make a room explode with sound and getting another speaker of the same to do the JBL connect is one of the best investments I've made

"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL-Bluetooth speaker,5,Got my first one stolen after only having it for 3 days  - figured it must be good So I re-ordered one!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",pros and cons,4,"The JBL stays better connected than my old BOSE, but BOSE has better sound quality (more bass, in particular).  This speaker is very loud though.  It's okay."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I’d buy it again,5,Great speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker.,5,"Sounds incredible, waterproofing stays true, very portable, just overall really good. Only thing is the battery life is not completely true as advertised. On full blast it will give you about half of the advertised battery life, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Everything else exceeds expectations."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Awesome sound, great bass!",5,"Amazing sound, really nice bass! Love this little gem!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for small package,5,"Connects quickly after initial set up. Power is fantastic. I work from home and not once has this run out during my usual work day. Sound is clear, bass good, but I have not cranked it to max as neighbors may object."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",100% recomendable,5,Muy buen producto 100% recomendable
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Nice product, crappy manual",4,Good speaker for the money. Very poor instructions. We are in America.  Why so many launguages? They spent more money on the packaging.  Which is very cool by the way.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fantastic sound quality,5,The sound quality is amazing! Definitely recommend this!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for a small speaker,5,"Connects quickly to my iPhone and provides great sound considering the small size.  I use it inside an office and bedroom.  If you want to use it outdoors, the larger models may work better if you are competing with other noise."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",How to operate your device,5,It’s great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jerret,5,I've dropped it a couple times and it still sounds the same. I can supply music to a room with a max occupancy of 91 like it's the rooms own radio
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Getting 3 hours total,3,It last about 3 hrs. I've had it for 3 weeks and can't go more then 3 hrs without needing to put it on a charger.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great but needs more bass,4,The sound is great but is very treble heavy at full volume. Bass is there up until you turn it all the way up.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Was great while it lasted, but only lasted 4 months.",2,"I'd like to start this off by saying this, the speaker was great while it worked. I am a college student, and I bought this speaker thinking it would be great to play some music while hanging out with friends in the dorm, maybe while I'm taking a shower, etc. It was a bit pricey, but the reviews were good and I had a few friends that said nothing but good things about it. Now, I have had it for a few months and I can't use it any more. One day the power and linking button's stopped working, the LEDs and everything. So while the speaker still worked, I couldn't turn it on or off. Eventually it died and now I can't use it.I am very disappointed in this product as it was marketed as being durable, however, didn't last more than 4 months of mild use. I would not recommend you buy this product if you are looking for a product that would last."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great. Not for super loud but the best sounding Bluetooth speaker for the price!,5,"Amazing speaker. Easy hookup. Sounds fantastic. The only thing was the large drivers on teh end sure look like they need protection so I added 
for JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Flip 3 Splashproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker Porterble Case by Khanka
 whis a perfect fit. room for a cable and a charger. I would recommend both!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",You should get it no regret,5,Excellent highly recommend ????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing portable speaker !,5,"I've been using this critter for a few months now... and now I'm convincing all my friends to buy one, and the best part ? We can link them all together during gatherings/tailgating/camping... and other events. The sounds is insane good coming from such a small package."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker out there,5,All good. Sound is great better than what is being sold out there. Hands down number 1 product. My son was insisting on buying it very first time but I kept pushing due to the price. however no complaints. Using it with iPhone.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Clear sound quality,5,The sound is great for the price. They seem pretty durable and you can link with another flip with just a push of a button. The only downside to them is that if they are linked the you can control the volume individually.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,4,JBL quality again
"JBL Flip 4, Black",So far it's been perfect. The sound quality is amazing,4,So far it's been perfect. The sound quality is amazing!  My husband lives it and was very impressed. I did not give it 5 stars because I've yet to use it near water to test it's waterproof ability.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",FAVORITE,5,JBL are my favorite!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL flip 4,5,Happy with this speaker good quality sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL is the sh#t,5,Need a speaker that’s small but does the job? This is it. I’m somehow who likes their music loud and with JBL I almost never have to turn it all the way up. What a great speaker. Crisp and detailed sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",it’s good! but battery life sucks,3,it states that the battery life should be around 12 hours. mine lasts about four. i am constantly charging it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,"Sounds great, connected to my android instantly. Going use it my boat but haven't had the chance yet. I think it will work well..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty decent speaker except...,2,"Pretty decent speaker except...  something may be wrong with the speaker's battery and charge that it can hold.I was really enjoying the bluetooth feature until the speaker cannot hold the charge for more than 10-15 minutes.Did I get a lemon?I have had other bluetooth speakers that are lasting longer than this one and they were much cheaper and have ""good"" sound.At this point I would not recommend this speaker to anyone because of this problem even though it does have great sound.  This speaker is about a year and a half old and it has not been heavily used by any means - I expect a product to do at least 5 years with moderate use.  If after that timeframe it fails or fades in performance well so be it.  My computers normally last about 5 years...Also, I would accept a replacement if the seller would be so gracious.  Other than that DO NOT BUY!!!!!GO BOSE in my opinion."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love my new speaker,5,Love this little speaker with great sound! Definitely worth buying you will not be disappointed.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,"Impressive sound quality. Just took this to the beach for the first time and it was perfect. You get the sound quality in a small, easily totable device. I attach it to a carabiner and hook it onto my cooler. Add a chair and a cold beverage and life is good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good sound,5,I like that it’s water proof cause I use it poolside and the kids like to splash.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it,5,I like everything
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Battery is a joke,sound cracks and distorts",2,"After 1 year, this POS crackles and the battery lasts 1/2 hr..the diodes mean NOTHING..1 light, 2-4 lights,Fully charged? then it goes red,plug it in and all the diodes light up,un plug it and its red!.(thats when the sound is obviously at its worst....Has to be plugged in constantly...never dropped,no water touched this even though it claims to be water proof. SO disappointed..I would rate the battery 0.0 !!! How Looooong has this POS been sitting in a warehouse?????"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best quality for price range,5,I use it ever day and it just sounds much better then other speakers it’s much more clear and loud and it’s battery life lasts fairly long
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bussin,5,Bussin
"JBL Flip 4, Black",5/5,5,Loved it. I carry it with me everywhere I go. Although I would suggest getting it black and not grey so the dirt doesnt show as much. Other than that its excellent.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound in a small package,5,Had this for a few weeks and love it. Paired with my iPhone and my iPad. Have watched a few movies and played hours of music while out in the yard. Love the ease of pairing and sound quality.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",just wow,5,I had the Oontz Angle Plus which I thought were excellent. I gave the Oontz to my relatives when I visited the Philippines because they loved them so much. I bought these as a replacement and there is no comparison. They sound much better and roughly the same size.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent product at a great price,5,All I can say is this speaker delivers way more than expected. Sound range and quality are outstanding. Bass tones exceptional. Took less than 30 seconds to connect with phone and even less to connect another phone. Use it while in hot tub so the water resistance gives peace of mind. Excellent product at a great price.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great speaker, but why the annoying sound effects?",3,"Surprisingly good sound in a nice-looking package.  My only complaint is the annoying sound effects every time you turn it on or off.  It's not a huge deal unless you're trying to avoid waking up family members or roommates, in which case, you're out of luck.  Even if you're listening at a low volume, that won't help, because the sound effects seem to be unaffected by the volume setting.  Apparently somebody at JBL thought this was a good idea.  Aside from that, it's a great product."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Just ok,4,"Dies quick, not as loud as my Bose"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Indestructible!,5,"This thing is indestructible! It's been dropped so many times, rolled off our roof even and it still works perfectly!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I recommend.,5,Good quality !
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, great condition",5,Everything you would expect from JBL. The bass is really good for the size of the speaker and the mids and highs are of really good sound quality. Everything plays crystal clear. Mine came in great condition and the packaging is actual better than the normal JBL box.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Better than the Flip 5,5,I bought the Flip 4 because it is stereo sound in one speaker. It connects easily to my Pixel 3 XL and battery life is good. Exceeded my expectations.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good value, great sound!",5,Perfect for my husband in the garage!

Already Charged When I Got It . The Color Is Even A Little Better Then I Thought . If Your Thinking About Getting This Don't Hesitate It Truly Is Good."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,This small speaker is packed with sound..love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black",A Must Buy Speaker,4,"A great speaker for under $100! Good sense of security holding it and not worrying about drops or spills. Durable, decently loud, great battery life, and a reputable brand. Might buy another one??"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice speaker,5,Sound quality is awsome.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,4,"Sound is by far the best in any Bluetooth speaker I have had, like the option of being able to skip to the next song like in others I have had."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound and design,4,Amazing sound and design. But only one drawback of this device is they said the battery is last long about 15 hours but the truth is just maybe 5 or 6 hours when full charged.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sounds,5,??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Jus sey Dat!,5,Oh yeah baby!
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Broken charger port, but otherwise an amazing speaker",3,"I would love to give this product a five star review but unfortunately my JBL charging port is broken and I can’t fully charge it. I’ve tried other chargers but alas I can’t full insert them fully leaving my speaker on low battery.But this little speaker is amazing, if you’re looking for a small speaker with a big punch without that Bose Priceline than this is your pick. I take it camping, hikes, beach days, and music festivals."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Great sound for the price!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great product overall,4,I liked the quality feel of it and the sound is amazing but when adjusting the sound volume there isn't much in-between the low to medium high noice levels.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker upgrade for echo5 and in golfcart,5,"Haven't used yet dew to there Christmas presents, but in store the sound was awesome. But saved money buying on Amazon. Showed up at door exactly when they said and when I needed."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker great price,5,"I have had a few speakers in this size rage and this by far is the best. The sound quality is awesome, and the speaker is verey portable (the size of a water bottle). All in all would recommend 10 out of 10: cheapest price I have found still 99.99 at most stores"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best one out there,5,Omg the sound is amazing. My son loves it. Its been slashed with water multiple times and still works great. I haven't put it all the way in water I really don't think I'm going to either it's a speaker

"JBL Flip 4, Black",AT this size - you can't beat it,5,Sounds awesome - waterproofing is effective  - perfect for travel.I reviewed this on my channel for a month and it quickly beat out the Fugoo Go as my favorite mini speaker.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Constant Skipping,2,"When I received my Flip 4, I was impressed with the sound and ease of use.  However, almost immediately, it started to skip in a random pattern.  Sometimes it played for a a few minutes before skipping.  Boy, was that annoying.Instead of using my computer and Bluetooth transmitter, I switched to my phone's Bluetooth and the pattern continued.  Thinking the Bluetooth range was limited, I tried using the Flip 4 right next to my phone, and right next to my computer.  No luck.I returned the Flip 4 to Harmon.  They sent me another, although I'm not sure it wasn't the same one.  In any case, same problem.  Since none of my other Bluetooth devices skip, it must be the Flip 4.  Nice machine.  Doesn't work for me.  I sent it back for a refund."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",You need one. Or maybe 2.,5,"Own 2. Handles dust and rain well. Only get 5 hours at full volume but sound quality is great. On large job sites I wish it were louder but then I remember it’s the size of a 16oz can, and not a PA system. Pretty amazing."

She brings this in the bathroom when showering is it is holding up great.  She also uses it in her bedroom.  It is compact enough for her to bring along to friends houses as well.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",?,5,Great little speaker.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","These are amazing for the money, size and sound quality",5,"This is the second Flip4 I bought.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Audio quality could be better,3,"I purchased this after I ordered and returned a defective Fugoo speaker. The reviews and Youtube videos about this speaker were pretty good, but it just wasn't for me. It got louder than the Fugoo, but the audio quality was terrible. Every time I tried to listen to music it sounded like I was listening through a wall, muddy. I'm a little upset, but at the end of the day I want to be happy with my purchase. I returned this and now have the Sony SRSXB3, which I really like."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL FLIP 4 LEADS THE PACK,5,"OK. I'm trying out several for bluetooth connectivity, bass response, clarity of sound, lack of distortion, and volume.  So far, this one wins out for sure.  It is LOUD when you want it to be.  Bluetooth connectivity is really satisfactory so far."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound,5,Bought a second unit for my daughter
"JBL Flip 4, Black",... static I hope not please let know but do love the sound,4,OK just got my jbl flip 4 today and when I am listening to it I heard static from it do you suppose to hear static I hope not please let know but do love the sound.

Incredible sound for it's size -- nice bass, treble is appealing (not screechy at all), lightweight, easy to throw into a beach bag or grab for the yard, and holds a charge for longer than expected.  Great product and fair price for quality."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not just water resistant; waterproof!,5,OK dropped this puppy in the pool while cleaning pool. of course it's autumn and the pool is freezing one Mississippi 10 Mississippi probably 15 seconds before I got it off the bottom of the pool and it's still running!!!!!!!! meanwhile I've had two much more expensive pill speakers that look very similar burn out very easily
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Amazing sound!,5,"JBL does a great job with sound—not distorted even at the highest volume. I wanted Bose sound with portable, cheaper speaker. Packaging is deceiving, thought I didn’t get everything but it’s all in there, have to search for cords and directions in the cover."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the $$,5,Love this speaker!!!! Gets pretty loud and the fact that you can sync multiple speakers is great. I also love that multiple people can connect and play different songs. Will definitely be purchasing more as christmas gifts. Reasonable price for the quality of product received.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",WASTE of $$$. Holds no charge. Customer support at Harman does not give a damn,1,"I am very disappointed with my speaker. for the first 2 years of use it worked fine but held less and less of a charge. At this point it only holds a 10 minute charge. I spoke with customer support representatives at Harman, Eric and Mel, and they refused to make any effort to fix my speaker. I'm pissed because they tried to blame the product losing charge on me saying that I shouldn't have let an ion battery completely drain. I asked them why this was not made clear to the customer and they said they can't make everything clear to the customer? I have purchased other JBL products for my family thinking they were a quality company, but I was wrong. My advice to you, get something with extended warranty. Don't purchase the warranty from JBL as they said it would not have covered the battery anyway."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Alta calidad,5,esta bocina es muy bien construida y muy fácil de arreglar las funciones
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect speaker,5,The sound the bass everything is perfect way better the the jbl flip 3 I’d recommend
"JBL Flip 4, Black",??,5,"Good sounding speaker. I bought two of them just so I can pair him and see how loud it would get. I really like these speakers, but I just wish they had a little bit more bass,  battery life, and the aptX feature."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this!,4,"Love it!! Great sound, perfect"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Battery life sucks,3,Great speaker. But they advertise 12 hours of play time. It's more like 2 to 4 hours. Very frustrating when you spend that kinda money on something so you can take it to the lake but it dies a couple hours into your day.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best sound for the portable speaker!,5,"I bought this black speaker. I already have Flip 3 and happy to use both. Sound great (I was a musician ), size well, quality the best ! Every time my home with my lovely Flip 4.  Highly recommend this speaker!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for Classroom Use,5,This little gem allows me to play music from any device with very good volume and sound quality for such a small speaker. Perfect for my needs. I do not know about the battery life as I usually keep it charging while in use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Mediocre product,3,For that price it must be better. It has ugly interface and it feels like sound is being unbalanced.Right channel noticeably lacks of high frequencies.It appears to be stereo but description and specs are real crap.To be honest I really disappointed in this product.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excelente,5,Práctico sencillo con sonido potente y envolvente para su tamaño. Portable y batería de larga duración. Recomendado

"JBL Flip 4, Black",when you sync one gets static,4,"I like the speaker it is my 2 one, but  they don't sync well there is static in the one that you add."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound quality, compact",5,Portable and splash proof. I use it every day via bluetooth. The battery lasts for hours of continuous play. The slund quality is far better than I expected - the small subwoofer transmits bass very well! I was excited about that.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Overall great speaker, bang for the buck",5,"Great speaker. Not big, but it bumps and the base is really good for the size. Clear sound and connected easily. Also lasts quite a while."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Horrible battery life,2,"Great sounds. Shitty battery life. Lasts less than an hour and you have to wait for it to charge before you can use it again otherwise it keeps shutting off. Ive had it for only three days, which is the worst part. Dont know if this is just a defective unit, but that is what is happening. Very sadIf they can fix the battery issue then i would be totally for it. The sound is great and had zero problem connecting to Bluetooth.Im returning now"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice unit,5,Nice speaker however will not connect with newer JBL FLIP 5 or up Bluetooth. You can however use a Bluetooth transmitter to do so.  Make sure it’s one that connects two or more devices.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL COOL,5,????
"JBL Flip 4, Black",LOVE IT!,5,Fantastic little speaker. Great sound especially lower to mid volumes. Going much higher distorts the sound some but the use I bought it for does not need it to go that loud. Easy to connect to my phone. I love it!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",So easy to set up,5,I'm a complete IT idiot but I was able to figure this out inside 3 minutes. I wish it were a little louder (I'm a metal head) but it does just fine in the yard.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good little speaker.,5,I've had this speaker for a while now and haven't had any issues with it.  I can't comment on how waterproof it is or isn't yet.  It fits in cup holders nicely.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good speaker for small parties,4,"Great sound for the money.  If I wanted a fuller sounding speaker, I could have gone with the larger one.  This is great for playing music with a small party."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect,5,Awesome
"JBL Flip 4, Black",What's not to love,5,Love this speaker.  Fantastic sound - it can get so loud I can never turn it to its full volume.  And the sound is great as well as the potential volume.  Packs tons in such a small package.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",great product,5,My son is very happy with this portable speaker!

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Freaking Awesome!,5,This is definitely one of the best items I have ever purchased from Amazon. The sound quality is amazing! The item actually looks much nicer in person than it does in the stock photo; it's a little brighter in person.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great quality,5,"I always love JBL, but I've never had a quality bluetooth speaker until now. Super awesome sound and connects really easy which can be a problem for other devices"
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Good sound, lacks long charge",4,"Good sound. Cute color (I got teal). When fully charged, only lasts about 3-4 hours, so that’s a bummer when it promoted longer."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good buy!,5,Great product all around. Be careful about the water though. I noticed some water underneath the power and sync buttons a day after it got dunked in the sink. Worried me a bit but it went away and the product still sounded fine.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good value,5,"Small/ portable for cars if you’ve got an older car. The sound quality is AMAZING, no matter how loud, it doesn’t sound like the speakers are going to tear like with the older/ cheaper speakers. Easy to use and to charge."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable speaker I've had,5,"It's super nice and loud and overall great. If you're on long desert journey's though, expect to charge it a few more times than you'd really want to, but I don't think any of these exist where that isn't true."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great for water, but does not float!",5,"My Flip 4 was submerged for 5+ minutes in Badin lake. Came out and works perfectly.  Love this speaker. I should add, my husband had to go to the bottom to get it! Does not float, sinks immediately!"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound and set-up is just plain great!,5,I can’t speak to battery life because it hasn’t run out for me yet.  Very easy to use even for someone who usually has difficulty in this area.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little but powerful,4,This little Bluetooth speaker has the best sound quality and battery life! JBL hit a home run with this awesome speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Two thumps up,5,I bought this for my son who loves to listen to music. It is great. Just the right size.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this item,5,I really like this product sound is really good. Battery life is great. Easy to use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL,3,The JBL charge I felt was disappointing as far as sound quality everything else about it was good though.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Reliable and Portable Speaker,5,"I love my JBL. The sound quality is great! It is portable and easy to carry. For the most part battery life is good. If you use it, the battery will drain like anything other device."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Strap broke,4,Strap broke after a week
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not wowed with Flip vs my old HMDX jam,3,It's a reasonable speaker....I have an HMDX jam speaker... volume wise the two are the same. The jbl does have better base I'll admit but 25$ vs 100 I'm just not wowed for the difference. Yes it's nice that's it's all weather but was expecting much better vs my 3 year old HMDX. The vendor is great no complaint for them. I did notice that electronic drum bass does not come through as well as good old fashion drums...speaker seems to be better able to handle them and produce the base.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Really waterproof,5,It’s actually very much waterproof. Left out by accident in a huge rain storm. It was even plugged in while raining and kept on working. Sound is amazing outside even with a pool full of rowdy kids.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice,5,Love it
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Once the volume is raise, sounds flat",3,"Liked- speaker is compact and convenient to take anywhere, good size, not too heady, sound quality really good except...read belowDisliked-when the speaker is playing music on low it sounds really good but once you raise the volume, it makes the sound quality flat...not sure why this happens and I tried different songs but it was the same...I like to blast my music so you except to have the same quality sound either on low and high volume."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Super,5,Suena espectacular
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overall satisfied,4,"Great sounds, durability and quality. The battery life could do with some improvement"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",AMAZING,5,Great sound love this speaker
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would recommend.,5,I love it! I can finally do my crazy dances to load music when I am alone at home.Bought it because I loved my sister‘s ä.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great bluetooth speaker.,5,I bought this as a replacement from the one that was stolen. This has great sound quality and volume. The battery life last for a while depending on temp if its hot out then it drains quicker I notice.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sound is great!,5,Outstanding!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,"its great, more punchy highs than flip 5"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The JBL Flip 4 far exceeds my expectations!,5,"I used a JamBox for years with my iPad to watch movies when I travel.I replaced the JamBox with the JBL Flip4 ...Holy Carp ... crisp, clear sound at low levels and room filling when turned up!Wish I would have purchased this a while back!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Exelente sonido,5,Maravilloso buen sonido
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Lastes Less than 5 Months, Harman Wouldn't Replace/Repair Red Version",1,"Lasted less than 5 months. Was a four-star speaker when it worked. Decent sound, good battery life, looks funky (in a good way), could use it in the shower. But now it won't charge (and I've tried multiple cables and connecting it to a computer and also tried praying). The fastest I've ever seen a bluetooth speaker fail, and I've owned a bunch of them, from Oontz to Bose.Adding more to my review now that I've gone through the warranty process. I bought the red specifically to go with my decor. Harman Customer Service told me they couldn't repair or replace the JBL Flip 4 in red because they were out of stock. I pointed out that they listed it in stock on their web site. They replied that the web site is incorrect. So...either Customer Service is lying or their web site is lying. It's now been a few weeks and they did send me a different version in black, which I'm selling on eBay. Meanwhile, the version I bought is still listed as in stock on their web site. You may have better luck then I did, and I hope you do, but I'm done with Harman."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Easy to use,5,This is our 2nd one to own adn we absolutley love it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds good,5,II like the JBal speaker sounds better than my Bose speaker. The sound is clear and rich.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the price,5,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it, for such a small boombox it put out great sound and the battery lasts for ever and charges quickly."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",As Advertised,5,Love this speaker!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",That's what I wanted! To see that smile on my daughter!,5,I bought this speaker for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it!! She said its the best speaker of its size that she has ever had!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent,5,I really love this
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Overall great speaker,5,"Great speaker for the size. Love the ability to connect multiple speakers to each other for a surround sound experience. Sound quality is pretty good, could use a little more depth. Overall very happy with this speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL,4,Good product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",BEST LITTLE WATERPROOF SPEAKER YOU WILL EVER FIND,5,"Amazing Bluetooth capabilities. Great for loudness. Stops playing music once submerged in water, but is waterproof. The sound quality is top of the line and will last a whole day or playing at around 75% loudness."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The bet.,5,"So happy I purchased this. Used it for my wedding (about 60 people), outside nonetheless...and it was perfect! We didn’t even have the volume up all the way! And the battery was still full after playing it for 6hrs! Came home from my honeymoon (1 week later) and the battery was STILL strong! Amazing."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",good value for money,5,i have a few bose speakers and this one does a pretty good job comparable and cheaper for the money.  this is also pretty durable - use it at the beach and tailgating.....highly recommend.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it,5,"The bass is wonderful coming out of a small box, I was amazed with the quality of sound, battery life is also very good"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Buy!!,5,Great size. Sounds great even with volume all the way up. Hasn’t even gotten close to low power after hours of use. Haven’t had to test the waterproof part yet.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great purchase.,5,"Read the reviews of many Bluetooth speakers and settled on this one. So glad I did. Sound is excellent, clear with lots of bass. I pair it with my phone and use it at the golf course. Highly recommended."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s loud,5,Gots some great bass
"JBL Flip 4, Black",buttons don't work,3,"my sister has this speaker and i love it, so i bought one for myself. i bought it new, have had it only for couple weeks, and the volume and play buttons don't work. i can press down hard on the pause/play and it stops, but only for a second. it works fine other than that, i can adjust the volume and stuff on my phone, but the buttons on the actual speaker are broken and serve no purpose."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One of a kind. Didn’t hear many speakers like that,5,"Relatively its size this speaker nocks it out of the park. Great sound, connects quick and has awesome features, if you don’t care for the color - you can get it cheaper — worth every penny"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes,5,Liked it very much.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker but got the wrong color,5,"While the speaker is great, I was disappointed that the camouflage is what I ordered yet received the wrong color. Other than that, it works great and is very compact yet powerful as a speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love It!,5,Good sound quality and battery life. Didn't have issues when it got wet. I wish I didn't get white because it got dingy from me touching it when my hands had makeup on them.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Sound - Poor Pairing,3,"When paired, one of the speakers often goes in and out.  They are not far apart from each other.  I got a white one and a blue one.  Doesn't matter which one I pair.  Disappointed as the quality is effected.  Use frequently at cookouts, etc."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Pretty good.,5,Sounds great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome!!,5,It awesome for traveling and at home use.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality,5,"I've been using this speaker for about two months now and really love it. The sound quality is excellent, and it easily connects every time to my computer and iPhone blue-tooth. I also bought the case for easy travel and protective storage."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Would buy another,4,Portable
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love,5,Love this speaker!!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great,5,"This was a gift to my husband, who works outside a lot.  He had no problem setting it up and is able to hear it clearly.  He loves the camo!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great for size,4,"I like the size, sound quality for the size and that it's water proof."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",One fatal flaw,2,"These sound good and overall work well if you use only one of them.HOWEVER...If you want to use 2 of these in ""stereo mode""  it barely works at all. As soon as you pause your music the 2 speakers stop talking to each other and as soon as you restart the music they have switched to ""party mode"".  You also can't get ""stereo mode"" unless you are using a device with the jbl app installed and open. For instance my Google home will connect to the speakers but will only play in ""party mode"".What frustrates me  is that the 2 flip 3 speakers I owned previously did not do this. They stayed in stereo mode at all times with all devices. Unfortunately one of them is non working after 3 years. I guess I'll wait for the flip 5 to come out and hope they have fixed stereo mode for that version."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and quality,5,This is my 2nd unit bought one for my son for Xmas and decided to get myself one.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love this Speaker,5,Love this little speaker - it has loads of great bass and works really well
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Yes it's worth the money,5,Great product
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!!!,5,Great!!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Big sound little footprint,5,This little speaker puts out great sound.  Good volume for a small package speaker that is also water resistant!  Sounds good also a almost forgot the best part.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good quality sound for good price,5,"Great speaker, long battery life. Too big for my cup holder in my car so I have to put on my lap in the car. Connects easily to Bluetooth."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,Great sound
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy that I chose this item.,5,I liked the quality of the item. It wasn't too expensive and the size is great.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good,5,Very good
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very nice,5,Sounds great and charge last.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Loud! Great for a dorm!,5,Super loud for its size. I use it in my dorm room and I am afraid to put it +50% of volume because I'll probably get reported for being too loud. Base packs a punch for its size and would do good in small pregame.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",nice sound,4,I gave this as a gift and she hooked it right away. The sound was really nice. Thinking of getting one for myself.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",The Bass is Fire,5,It’s pretty good overall I like the color and the sound is very good.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",It is an article of origin,5,Nice one do not hesitate
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth it!,5,"This thing packs a punch! JBL never disappoints... I bought this speaker because I lost my beats pill and was originally going to buy another, but this is much cheaper, waterproof, and sounds a little nicer in my opinion.. therefore, well worth my money!!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Recommend,5,We love this Bluetooth speaker.  Easy to use.  Portable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great,5,Perfect for outdoors or the beach. Sound is amazing is it a charge and carry with you wherever you go
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome speaker,5,"Battery last more than 8 hrs without a single charge. Connect easy to my iPhone. More than a year of use, no problem at all."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker,5,Great size. Great sound.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds great. Durable,5,"Absolutely love this. Great sound quality, and it’s LOUD. I get over 8 hours of battery life. Aside from light drizzles, and splashes. I haven’t tested the water resistance. But it’s still working great."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This JBL speaker rocks!,5,This JBL speaker is loud! I wish it had a little bit better bass because I listen to mostly rap. The battery has worked flawlessly and has good life. Well worth the money I work so hard to get.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Nice stuff,5,Nice stuff
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Defective Item Received,2,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I only had this speaker for less than a week! I played my playlists in the last 6 days with all the song tracks of my playlist that have base, falsetto, and any type of range & as well as all types of music videos. Just to be sure…now listen to this. I guess I got a broken speaker. Returning this and purchasing directly from the JBL website. :/Edited."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great!!,5,"This speaker is awesome, super loud, and has a long battery life. After a few white water rafting trips with this speaker I can say for sure it is waterproof. It also fits perfectly in the water bottle holder of my road bike. I live it."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best one!,5,I got this for my fiancé for Christmas. He loves it! Uses it everyday all around the house. The quality is amazing and the sound quality is great as well.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good Speaker,4,"Speaker sounds really good unless its at max volume. Lacking in bass as well. Bought it because it was cheap and only wanted it for when I'm showering, cleaning, cooking etc.. does the job for a good price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it!,5,"Is a great speaker, at a reasonable price. Wish it was a bit louder for big parties in outdoors but for the home, roof, small gatherings and so is absolutely perfect. Might be a couple more to connect them and use it more in big groups."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, size and overall awesome speaker!",5,We just bought for an upcoming trip. Easy to pair phones and it sounds awesome! We now use outside when working and I'll be taking to the pool. I love the size and bought a hard case as well!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Christmas Gift,5,This speaker was purchased for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I love JBL speakers so I am sure that this will be a great gift that will be of great use at the pool during the next summer season.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Decent mid range sound quality,4,Excellent value..  awesome sound quality at low volume but not so much at a higher volume...  otherwise it would get a much higher rating!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",great sound,5,Great speaker for the price
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I wish the battery lasted as long as it says it does,3,I love the sound and the controls. The volume is incredible for such a little device. But there is no way the battery lasts 12 hours on a full charge. It barely last 5. That’s my only complaint
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I’d like to first say the seller is great,5,I’d like to first say the seller is great! The product arrived pretty quick! The speaker is awesome and sounds amazing. The bass is good and you can hear all the lyrics/melody perfectly clear. The Bluetooth hooked up to my iPod with relative ease. For the money you can’t go wrong. Great product!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Five Star item!!,5,"Wow just wow, what can I say the sound that comes out of this little package is unreal. Hooking up is nothing to worry about super easy as falling off a log. The volume is huge in my book rating it at 100% I do need any more than this. I totally recommend this item over my UE roll."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Excellent Speaker!,5,This is a great speaker! The sound quality is fantastic and I love that it is waterproof and portable! A must buy.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound at a great price!,5,I bought two and they sound incredible...better than my Bose Soundlink.  I got the teal/ocean color and like it a lot.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great convenient speaker,5,Great speaker with amazing quality of sound.  It's portable and waterproof.  Bought 1 for myself and another for my sister and we both love it.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great Product, Amazing Quality",5,Great Sound !
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It's even washing machine safe,5,I usually carry it around the house. Once I put it into the dirty laundry basket while I was going downstairs. Then I forgot to pick it up and ended up dumping it into the washing machine with my clothes. This device survived a full washing cycle and still works perfectly. Two thumbs up!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Awesome ptoduct,5,"I love everything about it , it sounds amazing as I clean a Dr office"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good value,5,Good speaker for the price

"JBL Flip 4, Black",I would buy this as a gift for someone else,4,Sound quality is great
"JBL Flip 4, Black",SO GOOD (AND WATERPROOF),5,"I had an Amazon credit on top of the sale price so I paid wayyy less than $70, which is already a steal because they don't go for almost anything less than $98 base price even if it's used!!Best Speaker I've had!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",It’s Just ok,5,It is a good speakerSound is fullIt must lay down on its side for best sound quality and is awkward to carryIt has a strap for your arm but it’s not a comfortable wear
"JBL Flip 4, Black",excelent flat sound.,5,"excelent flat sound. great volume for the size, better sound quality than my charge 3, but less volume.the only downside is that at 3/4 of max volume, battery doesn't last as advertised, but I didn't expect that anyway.Didn't come with a wall adapter but it did with the usb cord."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,"Last one was a Sony, way better battery life. I accidentally left it in the rain, and was supprised that it still worked, I’m never gonna dunk a speaker to test it on a vaca. Great"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound for the price and size.,4,"Great sound for the price, much better then the UE Boom I tried, battery lasts, seems durable. Sound does not always link up correctly though when using it watching movies via macbook, sometimes there is a 1/2 second delay."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth the money. No debate.,4,I liked the product overall. The battery life is the only slight downfall.I mainly use it while working in a warehouse.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best sound,5,High theft ratio
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL Blue Tooth Peaker,5,Love it. Great sound and quality. Can't go wrong!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very pleased,5,"I’m not a highly sophisticated “sound guy.” However, I find this to produce very good sound, is extremely easy to connect, and for the price, I highly recommend it."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Sounds awesome for it’s small size.,5,Sounds amazing. Very durable.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL quality is top notch,5,Excellent sounds quality for such a small unit. This thing gets hours and hours of play time and just keeps rocking. Built in base takes it over and above every other portable speaker out there. Jbl quality is top notch!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",JBL has some awesome speakers and this is one,5,Got it for my daughter and she loves it sounds good and have to tell her to turn it down a lot cause it is loud
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Its a really good speaker,4,The bass is good if you turn on low frequency but overall it  is a really good buy. Also the 12 hour battery life would he better longer.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Charging cord not included,3,"I ordered this in June, to replace a prior model that stopped working.  My son just informed me now, that it did not come with a charging cord.  He was trying to use the old cord and it didn't work.  Not sure if it is too late to get a cord, but we cannot charge the speaker"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,Awesome product just what I wanted. Was not looking high quality sound but prefect for my porch
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Still works great. It paired easily with my I 6,5,The sound is decent for a little guy.I brought it on a Kayak and totally submurged it.Still works great.It paired easily with my I 6.I ran it for five hours at half volume and still had plenty of battery left.It has play pause and volume control on the speaker so I can leave my phone in its water proof case.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Broken charger,3,The speaker is nice has good bass. Last about 10 hours havnt test the water proof but came with a broken charger
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Perfect and it’s red!!,5,Love ?? it!

I use it on camp trips, around the house and hanging in the shower for morning podcasts. I especially like the volume controls and the fact that the play button will pause and play on my iPhone."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Speaker is great quality,5,Love it better than my Alexa
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great little speaker,5,"I'm not an audiophile, but this speaker is really impressive.  The bass is low and the treble isn't too tinny on this speaker.  I love that it's waterproof (I keep mine in my shower usually) and the battery life is pretty good (generally charge once a week).  The color is nice too!"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Good product,5,Ease of use
"JBL Flip 4, Black",After 2.5 years it only works when plugged in,3,"Good speaker, but after 2.5 years I can't use it for more than 5 minutes at mid volume before the sound begins to distort and eventually dies out. At this point I have to plug it in and fully charge it before I can use it again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Product for a Great Price,5,Sound quality is great. Volume gets really loud without compromising the sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Fabulous Deep Base Sound,5,Connected to Apple iPhone no problem. Having trouble connecting to droid.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",I love it sooooo much but a little after it stopped ...,4,I love it sooooo much but a little after it stopped charging but now it charges but dies fast I don’t use it on the charger or put it in water
"JBL Flip 4, Black",This sounds awesome!,5,I love it.  I am a musician and own a recording studio so I know about sound.  This gadget is amazing! It sounds great and the charge lasts forever.  very happy with it!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not exactly what's advertised,3,"Sound quality is great, however, water leaked into the charging/aux port box that is advertised to be submerged which after 2 years started to happen which (luckily) caused temporary damage of the buttons and soon naturally worked as intended again."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bluetooth Connectivity Nightmare,1,"Every time we try to use these it takes 10 minutes or more to get the computer to synch to the first speaker. Then getting the first speaker to synch with a second speaker takes another 10 or 15 minutes. Turn them on, turn them off, turn them on, turn them off. Push the two different bluetooth buttons on each one of them dozens of times. They connect to the computer for a minute then disconnect over and over and over. Then you get mediocre sound that does not compare to an old fashioned stereo system with good speakers. Then one of the speakers loses the signal, and the gets it back and loses it, and gets it back over and over. I miss my 300 CD changer and wired speakers that filled the house with sound. Home stereo has been ruined by streaming services and new fangled junky streaming systems and wireless speakers that have replaced real stereo."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Happy with Purchase,5,"Great sound at all volumes. Tight bass. Wasn't sure if I needed the Flip 4 vs the cheaper/older 3, but decided on spending the extra on the 4 for the longer battery life between charges. I'm sure I'll thank myself this summer when I'm either not near an outlet for an extended time. Happy with my purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black","6-Star Product: Premium quality, yet affordable.",5,"If I could give 6-stars I would. This is the ultimate wireless speaker! Great sound in a small mobile package. I take it with me to the park, the beach, work, and even use it to add awesome sound when watching movies on my laptop in bed."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great Speaker,5,Surprised of the sound quality.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Quality,5,"Great sound and material quality, best price performance speaker in the market"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Stereo mode ONLY works via the iOS app on the iPhone--NOT via a MacBook Pro,2,"I bought a Flip 4 speaker about a year ago, and was delighted with the sound quality.  So a couple of months ago I bought another Flip 4 speaker so that I could listen via stereo.  The JBL literature advertised that you could connect up to 100 speakers from the same source or use 2 speakers in stereo mode.  After spending a few hours experimenting and talking to customer service, I was finally told that stereo mode ONLY works via the mobile app.  Stereo mode does NOT work via a MacBook Pro.  If you are only interested in using one speaker in mono mode, this is a good product.  However, if you want to use this product in stereo via your computer--it will NOT work.  JBL's reputation just took a huge drop in my eyes."

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great product, I use it every day.",5,"I use it every day, simple to use and efficient. I haven't tried the more complex feature, like linking multiple, as I do not need it. I aso haven't dumped it into water to test the waterproofness, but I suspect it'll work just fine. Battery lasts a really long time! I'm very happy with it."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Love it! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 ...,4,"Love it!  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that JBL logo is the most distracting and annoying.  Logo color, placement and appearance is ugly."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Wow. Wow!,5,"Wow. Wow! Did not expect this to sound so good, so clean and so rich! I just exchanged the Flip3 for this and it is a noticable difference. Vocals, highs and lows are well balanced. It's a bit heavier than the Flip3, but its still so small for such sound.  Great job JBL on this one......"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Faulty Speaker,1,"It was cool while it worked for approximately 60 days and then completely stopped working!!! It won’t turn on even when it is plugged it. Now I have a useless brick and I will NOT be buying this model again. It’s annoying bc it was just after the warranty and I don’t really have the money to be buying new speakers every 2 months.I had a UE Boom 2 for like 4 years before the sound got kinda scratchy, so I figured the JBL flip 4 might be just as good in terms of sound but considerably cheaper.I’ll just pay more for another UE Boom - once I have the money for it. Very disappointed in this brand and speaker.I don’t recommend buying this - just pay the extra $40-$50 for a speaker that will actually work longer than 2 months."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",different color but PRETTY,5,"the colors in the pictures are too sea green and blue, its a teal color and its beautiful ?? this is a great speaker"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very happy with this small yet powerful speaker,5,Very happy with this small yet powerful speaker! Can't wait to take it to the beach this summer. The start up and shut off sound is annoying. Maybe theres a way to turn if off but I can't be bothered to read the manual. : )
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Little package. Big sound.,5,"As a Hospice Chaplain, this speaker is a valuable tool for my music ministry to patients. Compact yet sufficient for nursing home services as well. Functional, exceptional value."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker I've ever owned,5,"I live this speaker. The teal colour is even prettier in live. The volume can be ridiculously and it takes forever for this battery to die, I have not charged it since I've bought it. Pairing with devices is easy and quick and only needs to be done once. I'm extremely happy with my purchase."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",ITS SO LOUD,5,This is an absolutely great product! It is so loud and lasts for hours even in extreme heat! the teal color is so cute and it's worth every penny! I love this speaker

"JBL Flip 4, Black","Lasted me 9 months, not worth it.",2,"Got this speaker less than a year ago. I work in a truck 10 hours a day 5 days a week, there’s no radio so I bring this to use daily. Initially I was very pleased, great sound quality. The first thing I didn’t like very much was the battery life. They exaggerate heavily on what your actually going to get out of it when your listening to it at a decent volume. I was able to overlook this due to the great sound. Ok so nine months later this thing does not hold a charge at all, I can charge it fully and it will be dead in a matter of 30 mins. Just horrendous battery life not even usable less than a year after the purchase. If you want a speaker that’s actually going to last you look elsewhere"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Mini sound system,5,Product is better than I expected! It works beautifully. ??
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best speaker ever!,5,"Here is my advice. If you are thinking to buy a speaker and have not decided between the cheap ones and this one... chose this. JBL Flip4 is worth the extra bucks. Excellent sound, good long lasting battery and water resistant! What else do you want?"

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Worth every penny!,5,Awesome sound!!
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Best portable waterproof speaker,5,"The sound is good, the bass is good enough for the size of the speaker, perfect for a small-medium size rooms, water proof resistant 100% recommended"
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound quality but not reliable,3,"I really loved it at first. Worked perfect, great sound quality, good price. I've had it for about a week now, and it has started turning off randomly, even after a full charge. I think that it's either not charging completely, or can't hold a charge because I can't use it for more than 10 minutes without it shutting off. I am pretty disappointed because I was so in love with the speaker at first, but will try reaching out to the company."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great speaker at this price point.,5,"I won't rehash all the online reviews. There are better sounding speakers of similar size, my homework and direct experience with owning it now tell me this is the best bang for the buck at this price point. This speaker punches above its weight class. IMO you will not find a better speaker at this price."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound and build quality,5,Still an excellent product in 2019. Sound quality is great for a portable speaker and the price seems fair. I'd definitely recommend this. I will likely buy another for the JBL connect plus features.

Item was delivered in a timely manner, and in good order..."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great sound from a compact speaker,5,"Beefy, compact speaker with good sound quality. Haven’t really cranked up the volume beyond half quite frankly because you don’t have to. Bass could be a little better but overall really good sound quality with excellent battery life."

Thankfully, my son is going to let me use his Flip 3 on Halloween."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Terrible battery life even when plugged in ??,2,Speaker and sound are great… but the battery life is awful. Only lasts an hour after being completely charged (if that) Will die even if it is plugged in charging with cord provided. It’s never been in the water or even splashed. I bought a new charging cord hoping that my cord was just defected… but unfortunately still died within the hour after being completely charged.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Very good brand..,5,Great speaker very loud..
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Are we paying for the name?,3,"The JBL FLIP 4 is an amazing speaker. Is it better than other speakers at half the price? Maybe not. Are you paying for a better warranty, product support, or user manual. My experience with these things would suggest not."

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Disappointed,2,"Has GREAT sound production. And range is decent at about 100 feet. The issue with this unit is its performance. It doesn't have an adequate play time from a full charge. If you're looking for a quiet relaxing experience listening to your favorite classical music, at low tone, then it may impress you with stamina. But, for the rest of us who are looking to jam the set with some deep beat grooves of R & B, some ambient progressive House/Trance music, then 3/3.5 hours @ 0.75 volumes is the maximum time for snapping your fingers, nodding your head and swaying your hips.I have purchased other units in the past that have an even greater dynamic sound and performed for longer at higher levels of sound then this unit, go figure ??.Good Luck."

However, after 14 months it stopped working. basically the button used to turn it on and off stopped functioning and it could no longer be turned on. It was never abused, dropped, submerged or otherwise compromised. For the time it did function it was great. i called JBL for service, they gave me the run around and ended up offering to give me a coupon for $20 off my next purchase. Pathetic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! never again. i will move on to other brands and i would stay away from JBL. JBL should stand up for their products and at least have either given me a reconditioned unit or a significant discount on a new speaker."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Works great,5,Its small but great sound in bathroom and in garage.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great mini Bluetooth speaker,5,Great mini Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is great. They have the feature to link between another flip4 speakers (I believe should be the same model). Great feature and simple to use. I plan to purchase another one to use as a stereo mode to cover more room.
"JBL Flip 4, Black","Great sound, shabby battery life. Prefer ultimate ears boom products better quality products.",3,"The sound quality is really great, but if listening at high volume the battery doesn't last anywhere close to 12hrs. Kinda disappointed with how quickly the battery runs down. 2 maybe 3 hrs of run time is all than can be expected from my jbl flip 4 speaker.  Personally from experiencing both products if was shopping for another speaker, id definitely reccomend the ultimate ears boom line of speakers over jbl."
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Great,5,It was the perfect gift for a friend thanks
"JBL Flip 4, Black",Bland sound,3,I really didn't know what to expect but the sound is marginal at best.No low end (I've heard similar size speakers with far better bass).No definition in high end.Just bland.

"JBL Flip 4, Black",Not impressed but the opposite,2,Very disappointed with all the hype and hearing others that has this I was expecting more I dont know if mine is defective or what but there is no bass and not as loud as i expected I want to return but I need a speaker right now and dont want to wait till they receive it and send me new one. I bought speakers for half the price that sounded better.
"JBL Flip 4, Black",DO NOT BUY THIS SPEAKER!!!!  IT IS DEFECTIVE!!!,1,"MY SON PURCHASED THIS AS GIFT TO ME FOR MOTHER'S DAY BECAUSE I KEPT USING HIS SPEAKER.  AT FIRST I LOVED IT, THAT WAS UNTIL I WENT TO LOWER THE VOLUME.  INSTEAD OF THE VOLUME GOING DOWN, IT ONLY GOES UP!  THE FIRST MONTH I HAD THE SPEAKER, THE BATTERY LASTED ABOUT 3 HOURS. NOW, THE BATTERY LASTS MAYBE 1 -2 HOURS.  MY SON'S SPEAKER BATTERY LASTS ABOUT 6 HOURS AND HE'S HAD IT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.  STILL WORKS GREAT.  IT IS BEYOND EVIDENT THIS SPEAKER IS A PIECE OF CRAP.  MAYBE I PAID FOR A BRAND NEW SPEAKER AND INSTEAD RECEIVED A REFURBISHED PIECE OF CRAP?!?!?!  I HAD INITIALLY WRITTEN A REVIEW GIVING THE SPEAKER 2 STARS.  IT IS OBVIOUS THIS COMPANY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS OR ITS PRODUCTS BECAUSE OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AND NONE ARE REACHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  I ADVISE STAYING AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  COMPELTE DISAPPOINTMENT"
